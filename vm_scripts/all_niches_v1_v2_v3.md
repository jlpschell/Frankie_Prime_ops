## ROOFERS (Eric)

**V1 — Pain-focused:**
"Hey there, this is Jason. I was doing some research on roofing companies in the DFW area and came across yours. Most roofing owners I talk to are either slammed one month and slow the next — never really consistent, you know? I help fix that and can prove we'll get you 25% more jobs on your schedule in the next 45 days. If you want a free breakdown of how to fill your calendar year-round, give me a call back or shoot me a quick text. I'll put something together specifically for your business, completely free. Talk to you soon!"

**V2 — Social proof:**
"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just looking into roofing companies in the DFW area and found yours. I just helped another roofing company increase their monthly jobs by about 25% in like 45 days... without them lifting a finger. So if you want me to walk you through how we did it and build something custom for your business at no cost, just give me a call back or shoot me a text for more info. Talk to you soon!"

**V3 — Referral angle:**
"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just doing some research on roofing companies in the DFW area and came across yours. I recently worked with another roofer — they were pretty much relying only on referrals, so we got them to like 25% more jobs every month. And it's completely on autopilot now. They don't even think about it. So anyway, if you want me to walk you through exactly how we pulled that off, I can put together something custom for your business, no charge. Just give me a call back at this number. Talk to you soon!"
