## Content Strategy (Post-Setup)

Once accounts are live, here's the posting cadence:

| Platform | Frequency | Content Type |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| LinkedIn | 1x/day | Text posts + case studies, thought leadership |
| Instagram | 2-3x/day | Reels (short AI demos), carousels (tips), Stories (behind-scenes) |
| TikTok | 2-3x/day | Short viral clips (AI in action, contractor pain points) |
| YouTube | 1x/week | Long-form (10-15 min): how-tos, case studies, interviews |
| X/Twitter | 3-5x/day | Quick takes, AI news, engage with contractor community |
| Facebook | 1x/day | Mix of video + text, local DFW contractor events |

**Content Sources:**
- Repurpose competitor videos (use VC's transcript scraper)
- HeyGen AI videos (30-60 sec demos)
- Before/after screenshots (GHL campaigns, lead response times)
- Testimonials (once you have contractor clients)
