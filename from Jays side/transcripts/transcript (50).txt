Transcript:
(00:00) Two weeks ago, I built an AI trading bot, gave it real money, and let it loose on Poly Market. That video blew up. It quickly became my top watched video. And everyone asked the same thing. Does it actually make money? So, here are the real numbers. 550 trades later, 92% win rate. And honestly, the results surprised me.
(00:24)  So, a quick recap if you missed it. I have this Mac Mini running 24/7 that is sitting right under my desk and on it I built a trading bot using Open Claw that watches Poly Market&#39;s 15minute crypto prediction markets. Every 15 minutes there&#39;s a new market that asks will Bitcoin go up or down in the next 15 minutes and the bot watches momentum in the last 60 seconds and decides whether to bet up or down.
(00:52)  I started with a hundred bucks and the bot today has over 550 trades that it placed. Let me show you the results. Okay, so here&#39;s the 15minut sniper bot. This is exactly the core strategy that we&#39;re using and the infrastructure that we built to be able to look at what the bot is doing.
(01:11)  And as you can see right here, let me zoom in. We have over 550 trades, 508 wins, 42 losses. That&#39;s a 92% 92% win rate. Now, before you lose your mind, 92% win rate does not mean that I&#39;m absolutely printing money. And that&#39;s the biggest lesson that I learned from this experiment. Let me show you why. Here&#39;s exactly why.
(01:36)  The bot buys shares at like 97 cents, 88 cents. When it wins, it makes a few cents per share. There you go. Just like that, it just made $24. However, when it loses, it loses the entire bet. Sometimes $10, $20, sometimes even $30 on a single bet. So, the math is lots of small wins, occasional big wins, and occasional big losses.
(02:08)  But over $550 trades and $7,400 wagered, the bot has made $36. It&#39;s profitable. Now, not all coins performed the same. Salana plus $36, the star, it had a 94% win rate. Ethereum plus $3, basically flat. And Bitcoin minus $30, the problem child that basically cancels out ETH&#39;s profits. The Salana market carried the whole thing. And that taught me something important.
(02:40) You don&#39;t need to trade everything. Find what works for you and double down. Okay, here&#39;s where I need to be honest with you. The 15-minute bot was working. Salana was profitable. I was iterating, improving the strategy. And then I did what every human does. I got greedy. I thought if 15minute markets work, five minute markets should work, even better.
(03:09) More trades, more opportunities, right? I was wrong. The five-minute markets are way more volatile. The spreads are worse. The bot got absolutely destroyed. Then I built a whale copy trading bot. Found the top 20 most profitable wallets on Poly Market and I started mirroring their trades.
(03:33)  By the time my bot copied their moves, the price had already moved. I was buying what Smart Money had already bought at worse prices. Then I tried weather markets, different strategies altogether and each one ended up losing me money. And this is the lesson I want you to take away from this entire video. I had one thing that was working. It was genuinely working well.
(03:57) I was able to improve it. I was able to get it to a point where it was making steady returns. The 15-minute Polymarket bot. And instead of doubling down on it, I side quested myself into losses. This happens in crypto. This happens in business. This happens in life. I mean, you find something that works and instead of scaling it, you go ahead and you chase the next shiny thing.
(04:23)  Here&#39;s what 14 days and 550 trades taught me. One, 92% win rate means nothing if your loss sizing is wrong. Win rate is just a vanity metrics. What matters is expected value. I&#39;m working on better position sizing so the wins end up outpacing the losses. Number two, AI trading bots are not set and forget.
(04:48)  You can&#39;t just deploy it and walk away from it entirely. I had to build systems to monitor the bot. I actually have another AI agent, I call him Max, that checks on my trading bot every two hours and messages me back on Telegram if something goes wrong. I literally built a bot to watch the bot. Three, focus on what works.
(05:11)  The 15minute market was profitable. I should have scaled that and turned everything else off from day one. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing right now. Four, the real value isn&#39;t P&amp;L. It&#39;s not profit and loss. And honestly, I learned more about trading market microstructure and building autonomous systems in 14 days than I did in 4 years of crypto.
(05:36)  and I built a system I can actually keep on improving every single day. Okay, so here&#39;s what I&#39;m doing right now. I killed the copy trading bot. I killed the 5-minute market bot. I killed like even a hyperlquid bot. And I&#39;m going back to exactly what works. 15minute crypto markets. This bot right here is literally at V5 right now.
(05:58)  And as you can see, it&#39;s only getting better and better. Its win rate is only getting better and better. It has better entry, better logic, better risk management, just smarter position sizing, and the recent results are looking already much better. As you can see, I mean, just from today, we&#39;re up $22.
(06:19) $22 in a single day. That already doubles how much we&#39;ve made in the last 14 days from $36 to almost $50 to $60 in profit. And honestly, the AI trading bot is just one of four bots that I&#39;m running on my Mac Mini. I have an AI chief of staff that runs all of my day-to-day operation that checks on all of the other three bots that are running on this Mac Mini.
(06:47)  One is a content creator, one is a YouTube researcher, and one is the trading bot itself. So, four bots, four AI agents. It&#39;s completely autonomous all in this Mac Mini. And the total cost for all four AI agents, just a h 100red bucks a month. I&#39;ll be showing you what lives inside this Mac Mini in the next video.
(07:08)  If you want to see the full four AI employee setup running on $100 subscription a month, then subscribe and follow along because I&#39;ll be documenting that next. And if you want to build your own Poly Market trading bot, then watch the last video that I posted. It&#39;s just right there on my channel.
(07:30)  The code is there, the strategy is there, and now you know exactly what not to do. So you can learn from my mistakes. Anyway, see you in the next one.
