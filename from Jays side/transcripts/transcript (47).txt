(00:00) Today, we&#39;re going to give the most popular AI agent in the world, OpenClaw, the power to use Blender. I don&#39;t know how to code, and I also don&#39;t know how to use Blender. Because OpenClaw allows you to just add skills to the agent just by chatting with it, I believe, today using OpenClaw.
(00:17)  We&#39;re going to get it to use Blender and we&#39;re going to create a 3D model. We&#39;re going to put that 3D model in a really cool landing page and we&#39;re going to put it on the internet and it&#39;s going to be sick. Let&#39;s dive in. Hello, OpenClaw agent running on my Mac Mini. I want you to please search the internet and find skills about Blender.
(00:36)  I want you to create a Blender skill that allows you to control Blender that is downloaded on my computer via the Blender MCP. Search long and hard. You should be able to control it. I want you to wrap the MCP so that you can use this as a skill, but I want you to be able to control it. Figure out how to do it. Make this skill.
(00:47)  I&#39;m about to download Blender and then I will enable the MCP. Run it locally on a port. I&#39;ll let you know uh when I do that. Okay. So, we&#39;re going to run this. Now, we&#39;re going to go up to uh the internet. We&#39;re going to say download Blender. Download Blender. Install for MacOSS. Bang. Okay, here it is.
(01:05)  Now we can drag it in there. Now, can we open it? There&#39;s Blender downloaded on my computer. Okay, now we have Blender open. Let&#39;s go ahead and drag this down a little bit. The agent&#39;s still thinking. Okay, now it&#39;s responding on it. Okay, so now all everything is responding. Boom. There we go. Done. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve built.
(01:27)  Did you or did you not download the Blender MCP in step two? If not, please do it right now. Concise. So, it says download Blender, which we&#39;ve done. Install the add-on, which is this Blender MCP. I did download it. Okay, it&#39;s saved to my files. Now, if we go to edit, preferences, we see Blender MCP. We&#39;ll just enable that.
(01:51)  Now, if we come over to the side panel, we hit N, I believe. There we go. We see Blender MCP connect to MCP server running on port 9876. Hi. Uh, we are running the server on 9876. Can you tell me if you see anything? If you can, please make a little green field with some trees on it in Blender. Please make this. Hey, look at that.
(02:22) It made some fields with some trees. That&#39;s how easy it is to set up the Blender MCP. Why does the view not show colors? Please tell me how to change the view or add color if there isn&#39;t color. I forget how to use Blender. I&#39;m just going to I know that there&#39;s like a type of view that shows color and a type of view that shows these like polygons.
(02:47) Wait, maybe it&#39;s object mode. Okay. The viewport is in solid shading mode which shows flat gray. Switch to material preview. Okay, so now we&#39;re in material preview and see we have this little field here. And so we can say make the field larger. Add some mountains and please add some animals. And now we&#39;re just using Blender with Claudebot that&#39;s installed on my Mac Mini.
(03:14)  And then it can even send you a screenshot. As you can see here, it literally sent a screenshot. So I could literally open up Telegram later, right? I could be out doing whatever and I could just like spin up Blender and then, you know, I could use Blender and it could message me screenshots of what we&#39;re building, which is pretty cool.
(03:29) Boom. There we go. So, it added some mountains. It also Yeah, you can see some animals here. Very, very cool. Okay, I have a very specific project in mind, and we&#39;re actually going to download an asset from the internet to help us get started. Okay, so I actually just uh spent 20 minutes and found a Mac Mini 3D model, a blend file on the internet. I found it on the internet.
(03:56)  I bought it for 20 bucks and I&#39;ve never done this before. So, let&#39;s go ahead and test this here. Um, okay. In my downloads, let&#39;s actually go ahead and uh let&#39;s hit new general. Let&#39;s not save this. Let&#39;s make sure the MCP is still running. Connect to MCP server. Okay, in my downloads uh just recently downloaded.
(04:16)  I just purchased a Mac Mini 3D model. Can you please make that run on port 9876? I created a completely new project. Now it&#39;s just the cube. I want to see the 3D model on my screen. Let me know if I need to provide you with anything else. I don&#39;t know how this works. Wait, what the What is happening? Whoa. Am I inside a Mac Mini? Whoa.
(04:32) Am I inside the Mac Mini? Let&#39;s go zoom out. Let&#39;s see where we at. Oh, okay. So, we got this Mac Mini. Why does it feel like this is not like pushed inside of it? Okay, this is pretty cool. So, we do have this Mac Mini. So, again, my goal is to create a landing page with a custom red Mac Mini with the Open Claw logo on the outside.
(04:59)  So, I&#39;m pretty sure these are supposed to be named. None of these layers are named. So, if we click on Mac Mini01, we see that this surface is just kind of like the whole outside like I think. So, if we click M4, I think if we click on this, I&#39;m just going to tell my Clawbot, can you please make the whole Mac Mini red? It&#39;s the layer or whatever it&#39;s called, M4001, the part that&#39;s like gray.
(05:22)  I want that to be red. Like the most red red you could ever make. Please change the color to red. Oh. Oh my god. Okay. Wait. Slightly darker red, please. Okay. Okay, there we go. That&#39;s pretty good. Okay, what I want to do is I want to just get a screenshot of this little guy. I&#39;m going to just drag it into my image generator.
(05:50)  Going to actually add this as a reference image. Uh make an icon of the red claw uh red uh crab exactly as is. I&#39;m just going to generate a ton of these. Actually, we want to make sure that it is a square. Oh yeah, this is fire. Let&#39;s go ahead and copy this image. I&#39;m just going to say, can you please add a very, very thin, almost like no thickness whatsoever sheet, like a circle uh sheet over the top of the Mac Mini on the same layer that you just recolored.
(06:21)  And I want you to make this black and then add a this sticker to it. &gt;&gt; I&#39;m actually just going to give it a Google Drive link. So, I uploaded that little sticker to Google Drive. We&#39;re going to give it the Google Drive link because my Claudebot actually has a Google Drive integration because it has this Apple logo on it.
(06:38)  We want to get rid of this Apple logo. We want to put a sheet over it like a layer because this does look like an engraving. I can&#39;t select this apple. So, I want to create a layer over the top and then we&#39;re going to put the sticker on that layer or the image as a sticker. I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s possible.
(06:54)  I I don&#39;t know if you can just put an image on it. Maybe we need to convert it to some file type. I don&#39;t know. But we&#39;ll see. What the freak? Okay, it missed. Whoa, that looks sick though. It looks sick. Yo, you Okay, I&#39;m just going to take a screenshot here. I&#39;m going to drag it into Telegram. Yo, homie, check this out.
(07:16)  I want the circle to be, let&#39;s say, 40% the size that it is now. And please move it the proper location. Oh, there we go. That&#39;s what&#39;s up. Um, that is great. Can you please make the PNG bigger without making the um circle bigger? Make the image of the crab bigger by 3x. Maybe it would look better without the black circle.
(07:43)  Maybe we should just make the circle the same color. Like maybe we should just Oh, wow. That&#39;s insane. That&#39;s crazy, bro. What? Let&#39;s go. Which layer am I selecting here? Okay, the layer Mac Mini M4024 is the the layer that has the text on it uh which says Mac Mini. Instead, I want it to say open claw.
(08:14)  I don&#39;t know if this will work, but this is looking pretty damn good. Okay. Oh, absolute fire. So, here is our Mac Mini. If we rotate all the way around, look at that open claw. Here we go. So now what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to say, &quot;Please, can you export this as a GB? We&#39;re going to use it on a website. It&#39;s going to be sick.
(08:45) &quot; Okay, so it says it&#39;s exported. I just wanted to put it in my downloads. Done. It&#39;s in the downloads. Amazing. Please, can you have a product called Open Claw Computer? Make it $1,500. Just make um this Mac Mini big. And I want it to spin slowly. I want to be able to click and hold and move it around.
(09:07)  So now we&#39;re just going to tell our Clawbot to make a landing page with this here Mac Mini that we customized. It&#39;s the OpenClaw computer. All right, look at this. So it says it is live at localhost 8080. Okay. So, let&#39;s go to localhost. Oh, come on. Look at this. Let&#39;s go. No way. That&#39;s crazy. The open claw computer.
(09:34)  M4 chip, 64 GB. Oh my god. Let&#39;s go. Look at that. The open claw computer. I don&#39;t know how to use Blender and I don&#39;t know how to code, but I got OpenClaw to create a skill that allows us to use Blender and then I had it put it in a website and now I can say please uh deploy it to Verscell and then send me the public uh link I can use to share with friends.
(10:04)  Okay, so then it actually just had me approve this. So it sent me this link. I needed to hit allow and then I just said done. Oh, look, it&#39;s live. We can click on this app. We have this link openclaw-computer.vercell.app and bang, it&#39;s on the internet. We created this. We&#39;re selling this open claw computer. Check this out.
(10:27)  This is so sick. Bang. in the
