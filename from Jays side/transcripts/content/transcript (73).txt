(10264) I Built this AI Content Suite with Openclaw - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJEefVJeIwM

Transcript:
(00:00) I created my very own content suite utilizing my openclaw AI agent from YouTube scripts to video to social copy output to live streams and my very own content calendar that has officially replaced notion. Today I&#39;m going to show you the entire system that I built from the inside.
(00:19)  And honestly, it&#39;s just insane what it can do now. So without squirreo, let&#39;s demo. All right, so as you can see here on the screen, this is Clear Mud OS. I originally built out this graphic user interface on a live stream. I will pop that up here if you wanted to see my vibe coding process of kind of getting to this point.
(00:36)  I have since fine-tuned it. Uh but I did build it live. This is my dashboard. This is where I just come in to take a look at stats, right? These options here, momentum, performance, and competitors, and autopsy, these were actually features that I did not build myself. If you haven&#39;t checked out Thursday&#39;s video here, by the way, which is just blowing up, go check it out.
(00:57)  I highlight one cron job that I have in place that runs every night in the middle of the night to self-improve. So, my Muddy OS, my main agent, Muddy, will self-improve one thing on Clear Mod OS and one thing on Muddy OS. And all of these were built without me asking, and they are awesome. Now, originally, they were placed onto this left menu bar here, but I realized I can consolidate into the dashboard.
(01:20) So, pretty nifty. Now, I want to show you one of my favorite parts of this app is the content calendar. I have spent so much time on this content calendar. I have officially migrated Clear Mud&#39;s workspace off of Notion and I operate fully out of here. So, I&#39;m going to give you a preview.
(01:37)  Right, we have the Cananban boards. You can drag things from one to the next. I have one for live streams obviously, one for ideas, one for thumbnail and script just to show me where I am in the process with a given video that I&#39;ve approved to go down the flow of starting to record and do the research.
(01:52)  But let me show you within each video. If you click this, this looks almost identical to my notion dashboard. And you know, it brings in the long form titles for my YouTube script command. I don&#39;t have to copy paste each line manually. It is such a timesaver. And I also have this cool recording mode that my system, my agent built for me.
(02:14)  And then it also self-improved a teleprompter for me. I might have to test this one day because look at this. It worked flawlessly. I can set the speed. It has this line on the screen and it just goes. This I didn&#39;t ask for, but I thought, you know what? How cool. Let&#39;s let&#39;s keep it and see if I use it down the road.
(02:32)  Now, why did I build this? Why don&#39;t why didn&#39;t I just keep using Notion? Well, my old way of writing YouTube scripts would output this markdown file. Now, this markdown file has everything manual, right? It has all these different titles, gives me all the reasoning. It has, you know, everything I had to copy paste manually into notion.
(02:53)  Well, now there&#39;s this add to calendar button. And when I press that button, it adds it to my calendar and prefills out all of these fields for me. So that tedious task of copy pasting everything from what was originally a cloud code CLI/obsidian workflow for YouTube script. It&#39;s now automated to the point where like it saves me so much time.
(03:17)  You&#39;re going to notice something with everything I build. I build things that focus on one ROI metric only and that&#39;s time. How much time can I free up in my schedule to focus on the things that I want to do, which is making these videos, live streaming, and travel? Moving along though. So, the content calendar is great.
(03:38)  I can dig more into it in future episodes. Um, but I also want to show off this calendar view as well. I can drag and drop. I can do quick edits to, you know, the status of anything. I can move the date obviously manually if I wanted to. I&#39;m just so very proud of this that I want to show the world and I I hope to inspire you to build your own version of it for your use case.
(04:04)  Now, this research tab I pulled this I got to give credit where it&#39;s due. You got to go watch this Greg Eisenberg interview with Matt Van Horn. He built this tool called Last 30 Days. Link again. And I&#39;m not going to run a fresh one. I&#39;m just going to show you what the output gives us. You put in a topic, it will scrape Reddit and X for anything related to that topic.
(04:26)  It will give us a summary here with some key metrics up top. It&#39;ll give us key themes. It&#39;ll give us all the findings with the link if you wanted to go view them. And then suggested video angles. Now, I don&#39;t use this all the time. It&#39;s when I&#39;m really trying to validate an idea and see if there&#39;s a need for that idea in parallel with do I need to build this for myself.
(04:51)  Right? Moving along to generate ideas. Now, I also built this on a YouTube video comparison video here where I compared Cloud Code CLI versus Google AI Studio in the web. And I downloaded a handful of Patty Galloway transcripts. And at the time, I believe it was Cloud Opus 4. And I said, I want you to summarize all of these transcripts and create a methodology so that we can bake it into the logic.
(05:16) Whenever we enter in a video idea or niche, it&#39;ll give us an output based off of Patty Galloway&#39;s approach and criteria for selecting ideas. Now, I&#39;m not going to generate a new one for this video, but let&#39;s go look at our most recent one here. As you can see here, look at the format. It&#39;s great.
(05:33)  It gives a score based off of Patty Galloway&#39;s criteria from the methodology. It gives us a title, you know, a quick summary, why it works, a thumbnail concept, and then I incorporated these ideas to add to my idea bank or go into the YouTube script. Moving on to the idea bank. This is where I will spend, you know, 10, 15, 20 minutes every Monday writing my own ideas. I write at least 10 a day.
(05:58)  I got this idea from Patty Galloway as well. Big shout out to Patty Galloway. He&#39;s a huge inspiration for uh my approach to making content and building out this channel. And if you&#39;re serious about YouTube and don&#39;t know about him, go check him out. This I can add anything to a YouTube script and it will it will pre-select the title and the niche and fill out this data here.
(06:21)  Now, this is one of the most used tools in this OS. Well, aside from content calendar, this is one of the most used tools in the OS. I give it a topic or idea and then I give it some context if needed. When I run the YouTube script, it goes through what I have labeled a title, thumbnail, and hook methodology, which I have compiled from a number of different creators like Patty Galloway, Colin and Samir. The list goes on and on and on.
(06:46)  I spent countless hours on the brain behind the YouTube script generator to where it gives me these really good ideas. Now, I&#39;m going to give you a preview of what the output used to look like. I also built this in a long- form video here. It was also inspired by Alex Finn&#39;s interview on Peter&#39;s show here.
(07:06) You got to always give credit where it&#39;s due. So, thank you, Alex, for making great content and inspiring me to build out certain parts of my applications uh with some of your your tips and tricks. I will demo this a little bit later, but let&#39;s continue showing off the Clear Mod OS.
(07:23)  Now, this is another tool that I built here on the channel. I built it in a long form video in a two-part series here and here. Go check it out. I&#39;m literally using the codebase that I built, right? I may have improved it since, but the foundation, the the the skeleton of what this operates off of was those two videos. So, this is a really fun one because when you paste in your YouTube for a long form video, the methodology I have baked into this is it analyzes the voice, the way I communicate, the tone, and it spits out copy based off of the way that I talk.
(07:57) So, it doesn&#39;t need any predefined voice DNA. I didn&#39;t need to paste in articles of me writing to get my voice. It literally pulls it from the transcript. It pulls it from my audio. It is such a cool tool. And this is also automated with a sub agent that I&#39;ll I&#39;ll I&#39;ll touch on a little bit later.
(08:15)  Now, moving on to the live streams tab. This is a fun one. One thing when I started live streaming, I was like, man, it would be really cool if I had a tool that would automatically analyze the transcript from a YouTube video, create an optimized YouTube description for it, and then also timestamps of talking points and change in topic throughout a live stream.
(08:39)  A lot of these different tools I&#39;ve built in Cloud Code CLI and when I set up my OpenClaw AI agent, I brought everything in and it helped me wire it all together and make it work. It was very buggy at first. Listen, this was not a one shot. This is well over a hundred hours of work and iteration and sleepless nights because I was so energetic in getting it working to the way I wanted it to work.
(09:03) Right. What&#39;s really cool is I&#39;m setting an automation in place now where I&#39;m going to have an AI agent 48 hours after a live stream come run this command, copy the outputs, go to my YouTube dashboard, fill them out for me. As of now, I still do it, but I&#39;m going to hold its hand over the next 7 to 10 days, see how it does, and then I&#39;m just going to hand it off and I won&#39;t have to manually run this tool anymore.
(09:28)  Uh, but it&#39;s a critical tool to my Clear Mud OS. This next one is my copywriter. This was also inspired by that Alex Finn and Peter show. There&#39;s so much valuable information out there. You just got to go and consume content, right? And don&#39;t copy people word for word, line for line, app for app.
(09:48)  Take inspiration from it and make it your own. Solve a painoint that you have. Right? I don&#39;t use this section often. We have a newsletter kicking off here on the channel very soon. My agent Gary Vaynerchuk, he is gonna be pushing out a draft this week. I&#39;m gonna approve it for next week. I want to make sure that our newsletter always provides value.
(10:11) So, it&#39;s going to be different from our blog or our Substack, which is just repurposed long- form videos providing backlinks to our YouTube channel. The newsletter is going to be tips and tricks and prompts. It&#39;s always going to give value. Um, so it&#39;s optional. Check the YouTube bio, sign up for the newsletter.
(10:28)  that will be kicking off within the next week or two on a weekly basis. So, moving along here to the prompt library. This is something that&#39;s new that my agents built for me. So, I have in Gary&#39;s brain for the newsletter, he&#39;s going to start putting in all the prompts that he wants to include in newsletters in here.
(10:47)  So, this is all automated. I didn&#39;t build this. I didn&#39;t ask to build it. I didn&#39;t come up with the idea. They built the tool for themselves to prep for the newsletter launch. Pretty nifty. So, there&#39;s a lot of work going on here this week at Clear Mud. Now, this next tab here is optimize.
(11:03)  I don&#39;t use it often, but the goal here is to optimize past videos, come up with new titles, analyze the voice, and generate thumbnails. Now, I&#39;ll be honest, I don&#39;t use this thumbnail generator yet, right? But it&#39;s here for when I want to optimize it, improve it, and actually start using it. And once I have everything dialed in here, then I&#39;ll have an agent come in and automate the process of looking at past underperforming videos, go come up with new titles, go come up with new thumbnails, and set up AB testing for all of those thumbnails and titles.
(11:37) Right? This is a work in progress, but I wanted to show you how it looks today so that when I do another one of these videos breaking down this OS to show you the progress, you&#39;re going to see how far it&#39;s come. Right? So, I&#39;m I&#39;m essentially setting these bricks down. I&#39;m building a foundation and I&#39;m slowly building off of it with iteration after iteration, new vertical automations, right? Creating new sub agents as I hold its hand first and then once I trust it, I let it do its thing. So, so this one
(12:10) here is content cascade. This is just for me to double check to make sure that these automations go through. I deleted all of the old ones that were failing. I mean, there was like over 20 of them. But, uh, Hype, which is one of my sub agents that lives under Gary Vaynerchuk, he now generates 12 hours after a long form video gets posted on the YouTube channel. There&#39;s a cron job for this.
(12:31)  He goes and generates copy using our video to social command here. And then he will go post it across all socials. He will also push an update live to clearmo.ai. We now have a blog live which essentially I&#39;m going to post articles about products that we release as well as YouTube video articles, right? Just providing backlinks to the YouTube channel.
(12:54)  So, it&#39;s just regurgitating what I talk about here in this long form, but I thought it was a cool automation to set in place. And this one I&#39;ve handed off. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t hold its hand anymore. I don&#39;t have to confirm. It does everything itself. And this is just a dashboard for me to to monitor it.
(13:09)  And as I build out different verticals, I&#39;m gonna have the tabbed feature along the top, of course, right? So that I can monitor each of them. Now, sponsor hub, this is something that it built out for me because I&#39;ve fed my OpenClaw agents so much context about where I want to take this channel, what my goals are, short, medium, and long term.
(13:29)  It starts thinking in its overnight builds and self-improvements of, okay, keeping our humans goals in mind, what can we build for him? Now, I&#39;m not gonna I&#39;m gonna blur most of this because I&#39;m not ready to share my rate card and all of this, but uh it has a media kit, a rate card, a pitch generator for outreach, uh as well as an outreach tracker.
(13:50)  Right? This is something that we built that we&#39;re not yet utilizing, but we&#39;re going to be utilizing this in the very, very near future. And then lastly, this growth road map. I have to blur some of it. Forgive me. Um, I&#39;m not yet ready to share all of this with the public, but it self-improved and built its own roadmap interface.
(14:08)  It also built this projector, which sorry, I&#39;m gonna have to blur, but it gives me revenue projections for the channel based off of my preferred approach and uh where we&#39;re spending the most time. All through this application, you see this floating note tab. I&#39;m a big Google Keep guy. I always have been.
(14:28)  I still use it on my mobile for certain things, but now anything related to Clear Mod OS and content creation. No matter where I am, I can create a note here and I can add it to a project and then when I go into that project and select notes up top, it slides in the notes as you can see here on the screen. It&#39;s a pretty nifty tool.
(14:50)  I don&#39;t use it as often as I should, but as I start to spend more and more time in here, which I have been, I&#39;ll be obviously populating whenever ideas come up. A lot of the times I&#39;ll go straight to the video project to make the adjustments real time, but it&#39;s there if I need it.
(15:06)  And as you can see here, I had to archive most of them so that the sensitive data wasn&#39;t being shown. But I have a rolling muddy OS improvements um item so that you know during the week I don&#39;t do infra stuff. I operate, I create content, I ideulate, I edit, I post, right? I live stream. The weekends though, usually by the end of the week, this list is full.
(15:30)  Every weekend now on Saturdays is a big infra day. I&#39;ll spend 8 to 10 hours improving Muddy OS and improving Clear Mud OS. As of now, there&#39;s no changes to be made. So these are empty, right? I also have an option to view the files within the clear mode OS project folder. Uh this is a nice to have. I don&#39;t use it often.
(15:47)  I do have a documentation section that&#39;s rolling. So every time significant changes happen, it lets me know what version of the documentations that were on. Um it it it was first a markdown file. As you can see, here&#39;s my text stack, right? Um but then visually I also have this really cool HTML that I can just like click on and it&#39;ll take me to that section.
(16:06)  And as you can see, here&#39;s the architecture. For those curious, I don&#39;t plan on selling this to the public yet. Uh I think it&#39;s it would be a great tool for creators, but listen, I built this for me. I built this to solve my own pain points and more importantly, I built this so that I could and also light and dark mode, but I built this so that I could free up more of my time, right? And that I could use my Claude code CLI projects with them.
(16:37)  So, I can&#39;t turn this into a SAS product because it requires significant changes on the backend wiring with how this works to make it SAS friendly, right? So, this is just for me right now. [snorts] Um, and then moving along to the settings section. I will have to blur some of this here, but it just allows me to uh edit a lot of, you know, the functionality throughout the OS.
(16:58)  I have a brand kit here for when we start doing the thumbnail generation. um our Google Nano Banana Pro Gemini API key pulls from these assets. I need to improve on that logic, but I have a place where when I update an asset and generate copy rather when I generate images for something using our Nano Banana Pro workflow, it will pull from this brand kit. Now, it&#39;s pretty nifty.
(17:24)  Shout out to Derek in the community. He helped me based off of how he built his brand kit make mine better. And that&#39;s what building community is all about, right? It&#39;s not just copying people outright. It&#39;s looking at what they built and and thinking of how can I use part of what they build for me, right? And that&#39;s why I&#39;m creating this video.
(17:44)  I hope that it inspires you to do the same. Now, I do have a security and integrations tab. Listen, I&#39;m going to blur those. I don&#39;t want to um show those off right now because those aren&#39;t important for this demonstration. Now, now that I&#39;ve ran through Clear Mud OS, I want to give you a demo of how I use it on a weekly basis.
(18:04)  So, here&#39;s my YouTube script flow. When I&#39;ve already selected an idea, right? I&#39;m not going to show you my research or my generate ideas or idea bank workflow because I&#39;ve already highlighted all of those parts of Clear Mud OS. I want to show you when I have the idea and if I want to feed it context, what happens on the back end to pull all of that off, right? how this workflow actually works.
(18:27)  Now let&#39;s say how SMBs can utilize open claw AI agents to handle customer support. And I&#39;m not going to give it any context, right? It&#39;s going to do the research for me based off of that topic. Let&#39;s go ahead and run this YouTube script. As you can see here, it starts the process. This is a forward slashgenerate command via claude code because that&#39;s how I originally built this system and it&#39;s using opus 4.
(19:01) 6 for the first part of the YouTube script generation. How this works is opus does the heavy lifting. Then it presents me three strategies to choose from which you&#39;re about to see here in a moment. Um then from there I select the strategy. I give any notes if I want to make any changes. However, more often than not I&#39;m happy with the approaches.
(19:20)  I pick a strategy and then on the second turn, sonnet gets triggered because I found that sonnet not only is cheaper, but with all of the logic and methodology I have baked into these commands, it actually writes the script better than Opus does. Opus does research much more um intelligently, but Sonnet does the better job at writing the script.
(19:44)  And you know, you got to I got to put an asterisk on it. It&#39;s because of the logic and the methodology and all the research and countless hours I&#39;ve spent fine-tuning how it works and how it generates and you know rules if then right like requirements uh criteria that it operates off of. So keep that in mind.
(20:07)  you you you you got to spend the time upfront to get these these things working so that the outputs are desirable, are good enough for you and what it is you want to accomplish. So, it does take, you know, a few minutes here, but you can tell it&#39;s actually working, which is wonderful. All right, so it finished up. It took two minutes to run. Now, let&#39;s go take a look here.
(20:26) Let&#39;s go review everything it&#39;s done. Now, it does give you a summary of like what its recommendation is, but I always like going top to bottom here and just reviewing everything. So, it does a let me show you kind of like the step by step. It uh first it does a trend analysis, why this topic works.
(20:44)  It tries to validate the idea first and then it does uh search and discovery data, audience fit, content to product pipeline, and then a voice profile match. Right? Does it match with the way we communicate here with the way I&#39;ve configured this system? And then phase two, it gives me three title, thumbnail, and hook strategies.
(21:06)  Strategy number one, the live demo. I gave a pizza shop an AI employee. It handed over 50 customer questions. Interesting. Can preview the thumbnail concept. Um, you know, it kind of just highlights key key metrics here. And then it gives me the hook. Right? This is the most important part is like how does the hook sound? Um, small business small businesses answer the same 10 questions over and over.
(21:29)  What are your arrows? Can you deliver? Okay, interesting. Uh, strategy number two, how to bi how the how-to business builder. How I built an AI customer support agent in one hour. Free and open source. I like that. I like that title. What&#39;s the hook? If you&#39;re a small business owner and you&#39;re still answering the same customer support questions manually, what are your hours? Do you have parking? Can I book online? You&#39;re burning your time you don&#39;t have.
(21:52) Hm. Let&#39;s move on to strategy three, the replacement narrative. This AI agent replaced our customer support. Here&#39;s the exact setup. Okay. Okay. More demon demon like more more demo focus, right? Here&#39;s the hook. We&#39;re drowning in customer messages. Same questions every day. So, I did something about it.
(22:10)  I built an AI agent that knows everything about the business, connects to WhatsApp, etc., etc. Okay, let&#39;s go see what its recommendation was. Look at that. Its recommendation was my favorite. Intuitively, it&#39;s not always the case. Sometimes I push back and pick a different one. And this is also right.
(22:27)  I can pick the strategy and also this is a prompt mechanism. I respond with my favorite strategy. And if I want it to make any changes to it, I&#39;m just going to say two and we&#39;re going to send. And what it does now is it goes on to turn two. As you can see here, it&#39;s using Sonnet now, right? It&#39;s still using Rex.
(22:47)  Rex is our YouTube script writer, but Rex has access to both models. And depending on where he is in the workflow, he uses either Opus46 or Sonnet. And he reports to Gary, our CMO, right? So, if I were to go to my OpenClaw AI agent right now and talk to Muddy, he would be readily available.
(23:07)  This is not my primary agent doing this work. This is all divvied out to my sub aents to my chief of staff first and then underlying sub aents depending on what their role is within clear mud OS or muddy OS right and you may be asking why don&#39;t I just automate this honestly I enjoy coming up with an idea and honestly I enjoy coming up with ideas I enjoy the ideation process I enjoy making thumbnails believe it or not I enjoy editing so I have built all of these tools to free up my time to focus on what I enjoy doing the most. So, I&#39;m not yet
(23:44) ready to have an agent automate the YouTube script generation process because I am very thoughtful about what I create. Um, I&#39;m going to be honest, I&#39;m very selfish on the channel. You&#39;re going to notice that a lot of my videos, I build things for me. I build things that I want to see.
(24:03)  And then in parallel, I also think as long as five or 10 people want to see this, I think it&#39;s worth building, right? So, but first and foremost, I build out things that I want to build. Now, am I going to build out this YouTube script? Probably not because it&#39;s too general. I think there&#39;s enough content out there uh teaching businesses how to create their own chat bots.
(24:25)  This is a very older topic, but I just wanted to show you how this YouTube script generation process works. So, as you can see, it&#39;s being very thorough. I have a lot of criteria, by the way, in my output. It has to not only generate, you know, not only generate the script, it optimizes a YouTube description for me.
(24:47)  It optimizes uh suggested timestamps, which I do have to eventually edit once I&#39;m done with the edit because it doesn&#39;t always flow, you know, minute form minute the way it suggests. So, that&#39;s some minor human interaction I have to do down the road. I&#39;m sure I will automate that at some point, but for now it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something I do hands-on.
(25:04)  It gives me a copy paste a tags field, copy paste a uh obviously YouTube description as I just mentioned, copy paste a everything. And I&#39;m going to show you the automation from taking my YouTube script and adding it to my content calendar. I used to have to copy paste those code blocks for all of the metadata.
(25:23)  Now it&#39;s all automated. It is pretty sweet. All right, look at that. It&#39;s done. Now it gives me the whole preview here. And then I have the option to add to calendar here, right? I always just add to calendar and we go check out the content calendar. And look at this. It&#39;s right here in the thumbnail script idea.
(25:50)  So how I built an AI customer support agent in one hour, free and open source. The hook gets placed where it needs to gets placed. the different title variations get placed where they need to get placed, right? I mean, this has saved me so much time and now it&#39;s saving me money each month because I don&#39;t have to pay for notion. It is wonderful.
(26:11)  So, yeah, that&#39;s the process. Um, and then as you can see here in recording mode, right, we have our hook and then we have the whole script with talking points. Before I record a video, I always just read through it uh line for line so I can get an idea of the approach it wants to take and then I&#39;ll make any adjustments I think it needs to to to have. And then I just I I flow.
(26:38) Right. This entire video I&#39;m not reading off of a script. I knew the hook. I knew the talking points and I knew I was going to be demoing my app and then demoing, you know, showing off the app first and foremost and then demoing, you know, my favorite part of the automation in place.
(26:55)  So, I hope you found some value in today&#39;s video. I hope this inspires you to build your own version of it to solve your pain points. Everything I build on this channel, I I build for me. I build to solve pain points for me. Right now, the number one ROI metric I track is time. How much time can I save by building out solutions, right? so that I can focus on the things that I want to focus on, which is making each video better than the last and providing as much value as possible in live streams.
(27:29)  Yeah, drop a comment below. Let me know what you&#39;re building. Let me know what this has inspired you to build. And yeah, I&#39;m not an AI expert. I&#39;m building in public and sharing what actually works. If you&#39;d like to see me make a particular video around a specific topic, drop a comment below.
(27:44)  Let me know who you are, what you do, who your target audience is, and what your question is, and I will add a video to my queue customtailored just for you. Thank you so much for tuning in today&#39;s video. My name is Marcelo. This is Clear Mud, and clarity matters. [music]
