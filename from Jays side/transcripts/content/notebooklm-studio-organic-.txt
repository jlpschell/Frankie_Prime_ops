# Organic Evolution of the OpenClaw Memory File

According to the sources, there are no specific "best prompts" to build the memory file because the file is actually built organically through your natural interactions with the agent.

The OpenClaw system is designed so that the memory file continuously saves every single session, communication, and line of text automatically12. Because of this, Marcelo recommends the following approach to naturally populate the memory:

• **Experiment and Build:** Instead of worrying about exact prompts, simply start playing with the agent, building workflows, and testing automations3. Going through the growing pains of learning the system and having natural back-and-forth conversations is what organically fills the memory file45.

• **Pin Specific Notes:** If there is something highly specific you want the agent to remember, you can simply tell the AI to add certain notes to the file as "pinned memories"6.

• **Feed it Context Over Time:** Over the course of a week, regularly tell the agent about your personal and professional goals, your strengths, and your weaknesses36.

**How to Use the Memory File with Prompts** While you don't need specific prompts to _build_ the memory file, you do use a specific prompt to take advantage of it. Once you have spent a few weeks naturally interacting with the agent to build up a "gold mine" of data, you can use a prompt to ask the agent to **scan its own memory file and use those findings to update its Soul and Identity files**24. This ensures the agent's core personality and role are defined in the most genuine, highly tailored way possible based on your actual working relationship4.

To create the specific methodology behind his ideation tools, Marcelo downloaded a handful of YouTube transcripts from the content strategist Patty Galloway and fed them into a high-intelligence AI model (specifically Claude Opus 4 at the time)12.

He prompted the AI to summarize the transcripts and extract Galloway's exact approach and criteria for selecting successful YouTube video ideas12. Marcelo then baked this extracted logic directly into his Clear Mud OS commands.

Here is exactly how that methodology is applied in his system:

• **Scoring System:** When Marcelo enters a niche or video idea into his generator, the AI runs the idea through the Galloway methodology and gives it a score based on whether it meets Patty's specific criteria34.

• **Structured Output:** Along with the score, the methodology is designed to output a tailored title, a quick summary explaining _why_ the idea works, and a corresponding thumbnail concept34.

• **The 100-Idea Funnel:** Marcelo also built a dedicated web app based on this methodology. When he inputs a topic, the app uses Galloway's criteria to generate 100 different ideas, sifts them down to the top 10 best options, and then generates a script based on whichever idea Marcelo chooses56.

• **The Master Methodology:** Ultimately, Marcelo took this foundational Patty Galloway logic and compiled it with strategies from other top creators (like Colin and Samir). This created a master "title, thumbnail, and hook methodology" that now powers the brain behind his entire YouTube script generator78.

Before creating the "Add to calendar" button, Marcelo's AI YouTube script workflow generated a markdown file containing all the script data—titles, hooks, and reasoning—which he then had to manually copy and paste line-by-line into his Notion dashboard1.

To automate this tedious process, he built the "Add to calendar" workflow directly into his Clear Mud OS. Here is how it works:

• **Generate the Script:** First, his AI completes the multi-turn process of researching and writing a YouTube script. At the end of the final preview output, the interface presents an "Add to calendar" button2.

• **Automated Data Entry:** When he clicks the button, the system automatically parses the script data and creates a new entry in his Kanban-style content calendar under the "thumbnail and script" stage23.

• **Pre-filling Fields:** It autonomously pre-fills all the individual fields within the calendar card, placing the specific hook, title variations, and script content exactly where they belong14.

By automating the data transfer from the command-line/Obsidian output directly into his custom dashboard, this single button saves him a significant amount of time, eliminating manual data entry and allowing him to completely cancel his Notion subscription14.

# The OpenClaw Heartbeat File: Managing Automated System Rhythms

Exported: 21/02/2026, 16:25:27

The "heartbeat" file is the seventh markdown file in Marcelo's OpenClaw agent setup, functioning separately from the core six files (Soul, Identity, User, Tools, Agents, and Memory)12.

While the core six files define the agent's personality and knowledge, the heartbeat file is strictly dedicated to **automations**12. Specifically, its purpose is to:

• **Monitor automations:** It checks the system for any missed cron jobs2.

• **Manage schedules:** It handles routine scheduled operations, such as running daily system backups, as well as other recurring daily and weekly tasks2.

Despite its utility in keeping his automated workflows running smoothly, Marcelo notes that the heartbeat file is "not an important one to grasp" when you are first learning the system2. He recommends that beginners focus their time and energy on setting up and understanding the main six core files instead2.

**Soul.md** should include the core essence of how the agent behaves and thinks. Specifically, you should define its **beliefs, values, voice, principles, and personality**1.

**Identity.md** should outline the concrete details of _who_ the agent is and what it does. This includes its **specific role, title, placement in your organizational chart (if using it for business), and its daily responsibilities**2.

**How to actually write them:** Marcelo heavily emphasizes that you **should not overthink or over-detail these files when you first set them up**3.

When he first built his main agent, he started with almost nothing. His Identity file was essentially blank, containing just one sentence giving it a basic role: _"You're my executive assistant"_ tasked with handling his YouTube channel's operations4. He gave the Soul file a basic personality and vibe, and left it at that45.

Instead of manually writing out paragraphs of specific details yourself, the goal is to let the agent do it for you. After a few weeks of experimenting, building workflows, and feeding the agent context, you should prompt the agent to scan its own persistent `Memory.md` file56. The AI will use the log of your genuine interactions to automatically rewrite and update its own Soul and Identity files with highly detailed, authentic specifics that perfectly match your working relationship36.

# The Nano Banana Pro API Integration Framework

Based on the provided sources, Marcelo uses an external API called **Nano Banana Pro** (sometimes referred to as Google Nano Banana Pro) to handle his automated image generation1....

While he doesn't provide the exact lines of code to wire the API in these transcripts, he explains the conceptual framework for how it connects to his system:

• **The Brand Kit Connection:** Marcelo has a dedicated "Settings" section in Clear Mud OS that houses a "brand kit." His Nano Banana Pro API key is wired to pull directly from these brand assets, which include his brand colors, typography, and personal 3D avatars1.... This ensures that whenever the API generates an image, it automatically aligns with his visual branding13.

• **Triggered by Copywriting:** In his Repurpose OS workflow, the image generation API is not triggered in a vacuum. First, his AI analyzes a YouTube video transcript and writes social media copy for platforms like Substack and LinkedIn. Once the copy is complete, the Nano Banana Pro API is automatically invoked to generate accompanying images based on that specific text67.

• **Version Control:** When he generates new images via the API, his system is coded to save them as new version files (e.g., in parentheses like "2" or "3") rather than overwriting the previous outputs, ensuring he doesn't lose images he has paid to generate89.

**How to find the technical steps:** Because the exact coding steps aren't in these transcripts, you would need to look outside these sources to replicate the code. However, Marcelo explicitly notes that he built this exact API integration in a two-part video series on his channel. He directs viewers to watch "part two" of that specific series, where he live-coded the integration of the Nano Banana Pro API into his workflow1011.

Based on the provided sources, Marcelo explains the architecture and purpose of his automated cron jobs, but **the sources do not provide the specific code, terminal commands, or technical setup steps required to actually schedule the cron jobs on your computer.**

However, they do detail the conceptual framework of how the system manages these automations so you can structure your own setup:

• **The "Heartbeat" File:** In addition to the six core OpenClaw markdown files (Soul, Identity, User, Tools, Agents, and Memory), Marcelo uses a seventh file specifically for automations, which he refers to as his "heartbeat"12. This file acts as a tracker that manages daily backups, scheduled daily and weekly tasks, and monitors the system for any missed cron jobs2.

• **Nightly Self-Improvement:** Marcelo has a cron job that runs in the middle of the night to trigger his main agent, Muddy3. The prompt tied to this job tells the agent to self-improve one thing on the Clear Mud OS front-end and one thing on the Muddy OS back-end without needing any human prompting3.

• **Goal-Oriented Autonomous Builds:** The reason the agent can successfully build useful tools overnight is because it references the `User.md` file45. By keeping Marcelo's short, medium, and long-term goals in mind, the nightly cron job allows the AI to invent unprompted solutions that align with his vision—such as spontaneously building a Sponsor Media Kit, a rate card, and an outreach tracker45.

• **Event-Triggered Delays:** Cron jobs are also used to schedule delayed sub-agent tasks. For instance, he set up a cron job for his marketing sub-agent "Hype" to automatically wake up exactly 12 hours after a long-form YouTube video goes live to generate and distribute social media copy and blog posts6.

• **The "Hand-Holding" Phase:** Before letting an automation run entirely on its own schedule, Marcelo emphasizes a testing phase. He recommends manually running and verifying the outputs of any new automated tool for 7 to 10 days to monitor its performance. Once he trusts it, he hands it off entirely to the automated cron schedule7.

_Note: Because the sources do not contain the specific step-by-step technical instructions for writing a cron schedule (such as editing a_ _crontab_ _file in terminal), you will need to independently verify how to schedule a script to run locally on your specific operating system._

# Clear Mud OS: Building a Personalized AI Content Suite

Exported: 21/02/2026, 16:25:42

---

Here is the story of how Marcelo (the creator behind Clear Mud) built his personalized AI content suite, broken down step-by-step so you can understand its evolution and recreate the architecture for your own use case.

The Origin: Why It Was Built

The entire system was born out of a desire to optimize a single ROI metric: **time**12. Marcelo was spending too many hours on manual tasks like writing YouTube scripts, copy-pasting markdown files into Notion, coming up with ideas, and writing social media posts3. He wanted to build an automated, interconnected system that solved his specific pain points so he could focus on what he actually enjoyed: ideating, filming, live streaming, and traveling14.

He started by building standalone command-line tools and eventually wove them together into a comprehensive graphic user interface known as **Clear Mud OS**, officially replacing Notion for his entire workspace56.

Here is how the system is constructed, piece by piece, from the "brain" to the final automated outputs.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Building the "Brain" (OpenClaw Agent Setup)

Instead of relying on a blank chatbot, the foundation of the suite is built on **OpenClaw AI agents** defined by six core Markdown files78:

1\. **Soul.md:** The agent's beliefs, values, voice, and personality8.

2\. **Identity.md:** The agent's specific role, title, and responsibilities9.

3\. **User.md:** Deep context about you (the human operator), including your personal and business goals, strengths, and weaknesses1011.

4\. **Tools.md:** Environment-specific notes, credentials, and setups9.

5\. **Agents.md:** Operating rules, workflow conventions, and security policies9.

6\. **Memory.md:** A persistent log of every conversation across every session. This is the "true cheat code" of the system9.

**How to Recreate It:** Do not try to write a perfect "Soul" or "Identity" file on day one12. Start by giving the agent a basic role (e.g., "You are my executive assistant")13. Over the first few weeks, feed it daily context about your goals, and experiment by building basic workflows with it14. This organically fills up the **Memory** file15. Once you have enough logged interactions, prompt the agent to _scan its own memory_ to automatically write and update its own Soul and Identity files in an authentic, highly tailored way1516.

Step 2: Building Modular Workflow Scripts (The Command Line Era)

With the agent's brain established, the next step is building specific, single-purpose workflow tools using Cloud Code CLI. Instead of one massive prompt, build targeted tools with baked-in logic317.

**How to Recreate It:**

• **Repurpose OS:** Build a script where you paste a YouTube URL. The AI downloads the transcript, analyzes your natural speaking voice and tone, and then generates tailored social copy for LinkedIn, X, and Substack in your exact voice. Wire it to an image generation API (like Nano Banana Pro) to automatically create accompanying graphics1819.

• **Idea Generator:** Feed the AI transcripts of top creators (like Patty Galloway) to teach it a specific methodology. Have it take a topic and output ideas scored against that creator's criteria, complete with thumbnail concepts and hooks2021.

• **YouTube Script Writer:** Create a multi-turn script. First, use a high-intelligence model (like Claude Opus) to research search data, audience fit, and present three different "hook" strategies. Once you select a strategy, trigger a second model (like Claude Sonnet) to write the actual script based on your choice22....

Step 3: Creating the Front-End Dashboard (Clear Mud OS)

Operating these tools in the command line or copying text into Notion became tedious3. The next step is "vibe-coding" a Graphic User Interface (GUI) wrapper—a web app you run locally on your computer to visually manage everything525.

**How to Recreate It:**

• **The Content Calendar:** Build a Kanban-style board (Ideas, Scripting, Recording). When you run your YouTube Script Writer tool, include an "Add to Calendar" button that automatically parses the generated markdown and pre-fills the title, metadata, and script into a clean, Notion-style dashboard3....

• **Recording Mode:** Create a dedicated view that displays your hooks and talking points, complete with an automated scrolling teleprompter for recording days26.

• **Consolidated Tabs:** Add dedicated tabs for your Idea Bank, Live Stream Timestamping, Asset Management, and rolling "Notes" that slide in over your current project21....

Step 4: Delegating to Sub-Agents

A crucial part of the architecture is that one AI does not do everything. The system uses a hierarchy where the main COO agent ("Muddy") manages specialized sub-agents429.

**How to Recreate It:**

• Create a Chief Marketing Officer sub-agent (named "Gary Vaynerchuk" in Marcelo's system) solely dedicated to drafting weekly newsletters that provide tips, tricks, and prompts without hallucinating, using an automatically populated Prompt Library4....

• Create an automation sub-agent (like "Hype"). Set a rule so that 12 hours after a long-form video is posted, this sub-agent automatically generates the social copy and autonomously posts it across all social platforms and to your blog, requiring zero human intervention3233.

Step 5: Setting Up Autonomous Self-Improvement

The final, most advanced piece of the puzzle is allowing the system to work while you sleep by setting up overnight "cron jobs" (time-based job schedulers)34.

**How to Recreate It:** Because your agent has deep context about your long-term goals (from the User.md file), give it a nightly task to analyze the codebase and invent solutions. Every night, Marcelo's main agent runs a script to self-improve one feature in Clear Mud OS without being asked34. Through this autonomous overnight building, the AI has spontaneously created features like a Sponsor Media Kit, an outreach pitch generator, revenue projections, and the video teleprompter—entirely on its own26....
