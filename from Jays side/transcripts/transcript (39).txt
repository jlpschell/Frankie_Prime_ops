Transcript:
(00:00) Claude phone, you can call Claude with your phone and Claude can call you on your phone. This is the tutorial on how to set this up based on this video right here where I showed you how cool this was, so by now, you&#39;re already convinced because you&#39;re here and here&#39;s what we&#39;re about to do first, there&#39;s a handy dandy GitHub project for this disclaimer.
(00:18) I&#39;m not a developer, but I&#39;m pretending to be now with Claude Code and here is my Claude phone repo with everything you need to know to get this set up. I&#39;m also going to walk you through it right now and maybe fill in some blanks that the documentation won&#39;t quite show. Now, I did my best to make this very simple. I think we&#39;ll see how it goes.
(00:37)  Okay, here&#39;s what you need. Now, if you watch the previous video, you&#39;ll know this is going to involve the three CX phone system somehow, and don&#39;t worry, what we&#39;re doing with three CX is going to be completely free because we&#39;re going to be deploying a phone system in the cloud, and this seriously takes about 30 seconds, and what that does for us is we actually have a thing, a phone system that we can call like a business.
(00:56) You&#39;ll get extensions like 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1, 2, 3, 5, and you can make free calls back and forth between the phones in that phone system when you set up cloud code. Cloud code will have a number. Actually, we can give &#39;em lots of extensions and assign them to maybe our servers, which is what I kind of demoed and played with in that video, and I&#39;ll show you how that kind of works.
(01:15) Actually getting a phone number to one of our servers, it&#39;s a weird concept. It&#39;ll all materialize here in a moment, so that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing three cx. That part, super simple. The next part, the actual Claude phone portion, the part that will actually integrate what we&#39;re trying to do with three cx.
(01:30) This involves basically two services. One is the actual voice server itself. This is what&#39;s going to make all that fun VoIP stuff happen, sip phone calls. That&#39;s what&#39;s going to interact with three cx. The other part is going to be the API server. This is essentially a wrapper for cloud code, and you&#39;ll want to install this on the same machine that you&#39;re running cloud code on. That could be a lot of things.
(01:50) That could be your Mac that you&#39;re using right now. That could be a Linux server, a VPS in the cloud. It can be a raspberry pie and all it&#39;s doing is converting the phone call stuff to messages that Claude code can resend and then or can resend receive and then respond to. Now I&#39;m going to show you and walk you through setting up two individual servers. I&#39;m actually going to install the voice server on a raspberry pie.
(02:13) This one right here, and this API server will just be a Linux VM. I have in my server environment. There is a world where you can do both on one device. I haven&#39;t tested that, but I&#39;m going to test it at the end of this video. In theory, we should be able to do everything on a raspberry pie, including clawed code, so getting back to what we need, three CX free, that&#39;s going to be free in the cloud for up to 10 users. Easy peasy.
(02:35) I just said easy peasy. That felt weird. Coffee break for Claude phone, you&#39;ll need best case scenario two servers. It can be a Linux server, it can be a Raspberry Pi and a Linux server, two Raspberry PIs, I don&#39;t care. Or just one Linux-based device. This API server. Could also be a Mac desktop.
(02:54)  I&#39;ve tested that many times, but essentially two devices and then you&#39;ll just need two more things. I told you it&#39;s a little complex, but also not, I mean this is the most complex part is just talking about it to make Claude talk, to give him a voice. We have to use T-T-S-A-T-T-S service or text to speech for that. We&#39;re going to using 11 labs. This is not a free service.
(03:12)  It is paid, but I chose this because it&#39;s amazing. We can grab multiple voices and give our servers some personalities, which I enjoy. We also need STT speech to text to convert what we are saying to stuff Claude can understand. For that, we&#39;re going to be using open AI and they&#39;re whisper API. So you&#39;re going to need an API key for 11 labs and an API key for open ai. It&#39;s pay as you go. You don&#39;t have to pay upfront.
(03:35) Maybe eventually I will add local open source models to support this. Maybe you can fork this repo and do it yourself. You know what? One more thing this voice server is going to serve not only as a part of Claude phone, which that&#39;s important, but before we even do that, we&#39;re going to set him up as a three CX sm No, no, not S-M-B-S-B-C server or a session Border controller.
(04:00) This is also free, but what this allows you to do is add any device on your network, your home network, like a phone like this or cloud code and allows it to interface with the three CX Cloud. This device, this software just needs to rest somewhere inside your home network so it can facilitate that connection.
(04:21)  So whatever phone you have, I&#39;m going to draw a little phone here. It&#39;ll actually register and talk with this three CX SBC software and it&#39;s kind of like the middleman. It&#39;s going to talk to the three CX cloud for us, otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be able to talk back and forth. That&#39;s the stuff. Let&#39;s make the stuff happen and the first thing we&#39;ll do is get three CX Cloud set up because that&#39;s pretty easy and it&#39;s also an easy win because you instantly get a phone. So let&#39;s do that.
(04:42) The first thing we&#39;ll do is go to three cx.com. We&#39;ll go click on the top right, a little person icon. It should take us to a portion where we&#39;re trying to, or a portion a section where we&#39;re trying to log in and I&#39;ll just log in with Google. You can create your stuff right there. I&#39;m going to use one of my dummy accounts and we should be able to go to either ad system or my systems to see what phone systems we have right now.
(05:01) You should have nothing just like me. We&#39;re going to click on ad system. This is going to be ridiculously easy. We&#39;re going to choose the less than 10 users. That&#39;s our free cloud hosted option. It&#39;s actually creating your phone system right now, which is pretty cool. A little coffee break while it&#39;s happening, and then we&#39;ll just grab this info right here because this is important.
(05:19) This is how you log into your stuff, save that somewhere and then we&#39;ll just get logged in. We&#39;ll use the same credentials that we just saw happen that it gave us, and there you go. Your very own phone system. Now what the heck is this? Well, the first phone you can use is actually your phone with a three CX app, so you can actually download the app. Let me share my screen here.
(05:39) You&#39;ll be prompted to add a system. You can just scan this QR code and suddenly you have a phone. Notice my status went to green. I&#39;ve got a phone on this phone system, and you can add more users. They can add their phones, and suddenly you&#39;re talking on a VoIP network. You&#39;re not talking through your cellular connection, you&#39;re not talking through FaceTime.
(05:57) This is going through the cloud phone system that you just set up, which by itself is really cool, but now let&#39;s add cloud code to this. You&#39;re actually going to see that little, you can create multiple personalities right here for cloud code. Next step is setting up our voice server. I&#39;m going to do the Raspberry Pi.
(06:13)  Now, if you&#39;re doing Raspberry Pi with me, and I do recommend this because it&#39;s easy and fun and quick, if you&#39;re using something else, it&#39;ll all apply, but first we&#39;re going to have to write Raspberry Pi os to our SD card. I&#39;m going to do that right now. Now don&#39;t you stink and do it.
(06:28) Don&#39;t you dare try to write the latest OS to this card because of the three CX. SBC does not like it right now. Maybe it will in the future. I don&#39;t know. Right now it hates it. So I&#39;m going to launch the Raspberry Pi imager. I&#39;ll choose my model Raspberry PI five, and here&#39;s the kicker.
(06:44) We&#39;re going to choose raspberry pi os other, and then we&#39;re going to find bookworm. We&#39;re going to scroll down a bit. Raspberry pi os legacy 64 bit, and we want the light version for command line only, unless you want that gooey. There we go. 64 bit legacy light. Perfect, and we&#39;re going to write that to our card.
(07:04) Feel free to add all your information in to make it easier to connect to your Raspberry Pi. I&#39;m not going to cover that here, including your wifi information, and we&#39;ll go and start that right process. It should prompt you for a password. My grandma&#39;s leaving. I have to go say goodbye to her real quick.
(07:17) I&#39;ll be right back. It should be done when I get back. All right. Say goodbye to grandma, it is done, and get this bad boy booted up. Turn my car. Okay, while it&#39;s booting up, we&#39;re going to do one thing. We&#39;re back at our three CX dashboard or our cloud. Now we&#39;re going to go to the bottom left and click on the admin cog right here, and then we&#39;ll go to voice and chat right here in the menu and you&#39;ll see the option to add an SBC. That&#39;s our session board of controller. Let&#39;s add one,
(07:46) click on add. Choose your option. You can do Windows. It&#39;s pretty cool. Linux or Raspberry Pi. That&#39;s our option we&#39;re going to go with right now. Continue, and then it&#39;s going to give you what you need to set the sucker up. This is what we&#39;re going to need right now. I&#39;m going to check and see what my Raspberry Pi IP address is as he&#39;s coming up.
(08:03) We&#39;ll get connected and I&#39;ll run this command they gave me. This will install the three CX SBC. Now, don&#39;t close this dialogue yet. We&#39;re going to need all this information. Let&#39;s get going. Accept everything blindly. First things first, it&#39;s going to ask for our portal information or our provisioning URL.
(08:22) It&#39;s the guy right here, the blah, blah, blah, three CX cloud. Hit okay. Then we&#39;ll need our authentication key. Let&#39;s grab that copy paste, hit okay, and it&#39;s going to install excellent. It should be done. What we&#39;re going to do now is we&#39;re going to go to our three CX cloud once more, get back to voice and chat, and we should see that next to our SBC sitting right there.
(08:43) We&#39;ve got a green square. It&#39;s at green because I&#39;m colorblind. I&#39;m not sure. It looks green to me. If I go to statistics when I jump in there, it should say up for 17 seconds. Awesome. So now our SBC is in place. Now we&#39;re going to set up our API server, and that&#39;s going to go on the same device that was running cloud code.
(09:00) So we&#39;re going to go to my Claude code repo here, and we&#39;re going to run this command, the one line install, or we&#39;ll paste our installer command. It&#39;ll do some prereqs. Make sure you have docker installed node js, make sure you have CLO installed, and by the end, you should see something like this.
(09:16) So now we&#39;re going to run Claude phone setup. This is a command you now have on your system. Ready, set, go. It&#39;s going to ask us, Hey, what kind of system are you doing right now or are you installing? We&#39;re going to be doing the API server. Let&#39;s select that. Select your port. 3, 3, 3, 3 is the default. It&#39;s good for me and it should be installed.
(09:33) Now let&#39;s start it. We&#39;ll do Claude phone start. It&#39;s running. Let&#39;s do a quick SS dash, tuin and GRE four port 3, 3, 3, 3. See if it&#39;s running. There it is. Our API server is up, and if I type in Claude, just Claude, I&#39;ll make sure Claude is indeed installed. Ready to go. It is.
(09:52) Let&#39;s get out of there. Now we&#39;re going to set up the voice server on our Raspberry Pi back here in Raspberry Piland. We&#39;re going to paste that same setup, command, the same installer, and it&#39;ll also go through the whole process of making sure it gets installed. Docker, everything. We need to run cloud phone.
(10:08)  Again, I&#39;m not really a developer, but I&#39;m pretty proud of this. But if there&#39;s ways to improve this, please let me know. I&#39;m open to critiques. Now, real quick, to make Docker work, well, we may need to add this one command here. New group, Docker, and then we&#39;ll run cloud phone setup here.
(10:25) We&#39;re going to be doing our voice server. Notice it detected that our SBC is installed. Perfect, and let&#39;s tellt the IP address of the server that&#39;s running our API server. What was that IP address? 10 77 14. One six. Three four. Three three. Three. Three. That&#39;s correct.
(10:43)  And now for our API keys, I, when I paste in my 11 labs, it&#39;s going to verify. I&#39;m going to paste in my voice or my voice id, and then for our open, API key. And then now for our three CX info, we&#39;ll get back to our cloud information here, go to our dashboard. Actually, we&#39;re going to go straight here. We&#39;ll go to our users.
(11:03)  And you know what? We&#39;re going to create a new user right now. We&#39;re going to create our first user that will be interact with Claude Code. That will actually be Claude code. So add a new user. We can make this up. I&#39;ll call him or I&#39;ll call her Susie. Susie, Claude. And that&#39;s all we need. Click on save. We&#39;ll jump into Susie Claude&#39;s user.
(11:20) We&#39;ll go to IP phone and we&#39;ll say, let&#39;s configure a phone for her. Ignore this. We&#39;re going to click on, I will configure a phone myself. Click on next and then say, how are we going to connect this phone via our SBC that we just made this raspberry pie over here and click on add phone.
(11:34) This is the info we need right now. So the host name or ip, I&#39;m going to grab this, the blah, blah, blah. Three cx.cloud. That&#39;s what we&#39;re pasting in here. And then we can just name her. We&#39;ll name her. Susie, this is not so important right here. Her extension, however is important, which was 2 6 2 1, 1, paste that in there, and then the SIP off id, which is right here.
(12:01) And then the sip off password, which is right here. For some reason, it asks about the voice ID again, but it&#39;s already prefilled. We&#39;re good. You can say a system prompt like who you are. We&#39;ll leave it as default right now, and then it&#39;s just going to ask you, do you want to use this IP address for your raspberry pie, for audio and for the HTTP port? Yes. Okay, that&#39;s it.
(12:23) Now let&#39;s do Claude phone start. Fingers stinking crossed. So right now, what it&#39;s doing, if you watch my first video, it is getting those very intense, not too intense Docker containers ready. It&#39;s free. Switch and drop, Teo. And this will give us the ability to talk back and forth with cloud code.
(12:41) Give it a little second here. Okay, containers are initialized. I going to give it just a moment for them to come up and be good. Actually, we can check it right now. Docker. Ps they&#39;re up. They&#39;re healthy. This is exciting. Now our test, we&#39;re going to use three cx, our phone here to call and talk to Susie, which is Claude Code.
(13:03) What was her extension again? It was 2 6 2 1 1. There she is. She is available. She&#39;s registered. Let&#39;s see if she picks up. How can I help you today? Hey Susie, what&#39;s the weather in Washington DC right now? Sorry, something went wrong. Whenever Susie. Okay, well she&#39;s being mean. I&#39;ll have to fix that. Okay. The issue wasn&#39;t with my software.
(13:27) The issue was that I needed to add some billing to my open ai. I&#39;ve been exhausting it. So now check this out. Let&#39;s talk to Susie. Hey Susie, can you tell me the weather in Washington DC right now. Consulting the Oracle? It works, and we don&#39;t have hold music yet. I&#39;ll add that soon for the automatic setup, but the hold music I had on my system is copyrighted.
(13:51) I&#39;ll have to get you guys some free stuff. So right now, Susie is cloud code. It&#39;s currently 54 degrees and partly cloudy in dc Nice for late January, but heads up a major winter storm is coming this weekend with four to eight inches of snow expected. I forgot about that. Okay, cool. So Susie&#39;s there.
(14:10) I want to show off just a few more things actually, just one more thing. At the risk of making this video too long, we can add more devices. So if we get back to our cloud three cx, I want to add another user call this one Steward Ross. I don&#39;t know who that is. Let&#39;s add a phone to Stewart Ross and let&#39;s get back to our device and add a new one. Do Claude phone devices, I think.
(14:33) Yeah, device add. Device name. Stewart. Let&#39;s grab his extension off ID and authentication password, and we&#39;ll give him a new voice. Let&#39;s give him Oliver, you are Stuart, an annoying help desk agent who always tells a dad joke and done. Let&#39;s take Don Claude phone, bring it back up. Give it just a second and let&#39;s try calling Stuart. Oh, there he is. Stuart Ross, let&#39;s call him.
(15:24) How can I help you today? Hey Stuart, can you tell me how you&#39;re doing? Interesting question. Oh, I&#39;m doing great, just like a broken pencil. Completely pointless, but hey, at least I&#39;m here to help with all your tech troubles. What can I fix for you today? You get us see in the power here so we can set up multiple personalities, multiple voices, and then we can have it more intense to where we give it a system prompt where you&#39;re supposed to use only one cloud code skill.
(15:54) And you can go in there and maybe it&#39;s a skill that will troubleshoot our na or it&#39;s a skill that will troubleshoot our prox Max. So you can call and talk to your prox mock server. You can say you are a prox server. This is your stinking job. This is all you do. That&#39;s cool. At least I think it is.
(16:10) So that&#39;s the basic setup. I&#39;ll have more documentation here. I&#39;ll try to finesse a few more things, add more features as I do stuff. It&#39;s kind of my project now, but feel free to fork it and do other stuff, but I&#39;m also not going to support this forever. So more POC. Anyways, that&#39;s all I got. I&#39;ll catch you guys next time. Hey, you&#39;re still here.
(16:32)  Yes, I do even still pray for my audience on my second channel if you&#39;re new to me. And what I do, I do like to pray for you because I genuinely care about each and every one of you. I love you guys and I want to see you succeed in your careers and your lives. I&#39;m going to pray for you right now. If it&#39;s not your thing, let&#39;s see if it is.
(16:48) Try it out. Ready, set, go. God, I thank you for the person on the other side of the screen. I thank you that they are here, that they&#39;ve watched an entire tutorial on a phone system thing that tells me they are passionate about tech and that they have so much potential and opportunity. And I ask that you would just bless them in that right now, that you would go before them, make their path straight, bless their careers.
(17:13) If they&#39;re searching for a job right now, they&#39;re having a hard time, God, open up those doors. Encourage them to keep applying, to keep studying, to keep working at it, and give them great success in that. Lord, let the right job, the right person, the right interview. Just hear them and see them. Give them the words to say and let them be excited.
(17:33) Let them be so excited about this. And if they&#39;re already in their job, just let them continue to just be amazing. I know they&#39;re valuable at that company and just provide them with a ton of blessing and opportunity. God, I ask this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Alright, I&#39;ll talk to you guys next time.
