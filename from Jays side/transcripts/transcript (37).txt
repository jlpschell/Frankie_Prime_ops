Transcript:
(00:00) OpenClaw is the fastest growing open-source AI project of all time. And somehow, even with all that hype behind it, there is not a single good guide that shows you how to properly set up this thing in the cloud and connect the one tool you need to actually turn it into a proper AI assistant, and that&#39;s your Google account.
(00:22)  But we need to do better than just give it access to your email, your drive, and your calendar. We need to do it in a secure fashion that makes sure if anything goes wrong, we didn&#39;t just give the keys to the entire kingdom to a bad actor. Now, be warned. Connecting OpenClaw to your Google Workspace is a giant pain in the butt, which is why all these AI influencers skip this step entirely when they show you how to set up OpenClaw.
(00:47)  But I am going to show you everything in this video so we can navigate all these weird technical hurdles that are in front of us and getting OpenClaw actually up and running. And at the end of this video, you&#39;ll also get my take on OpenClaw at large and where I think this thing can actually provide some value admits all this wild hype.
(01:06)  So, let&#39;s first talk about the hosting options very quickly. Three big options for where OpenClaw can live. Number one, and this is what you see all over the place, is a Mac Mini. This is expensive, right? This is going to run you $400 to $600, but you can connect it to your Mac and it&#39;s going to be up and running all the time.
(01:23)  Your second option is to host it somewhere on the cloud. So you&#39;re paying some third party say hosting your $7 to $10 a month. Again, very cheap to essentially give you space on one of their servers, which is where OpenCloud will live. Third option is to host it directly on your computer.
(01:41)  So it&#39;s not in the cloud, it&#39;s also not on your Mac Mini, it&#39;s right on your machine. Now, the downside with having it right on your machine is if you want OpenClaw running all the time, well then your machine needs to be running all the time, which for most people that&#39;s just not the case. And in today&#39;s video, what we&#39;re going to focus on is the third-party option, actually hosting it on a VPS.
(02:00)  And that&#39;s because this is something everyone can do, right? Whether you&#39;re on Linux or Windows or a Mac, everyone can do this, right? So, I think this is going to be the easiest option for most people. This doesn&#39;t require you to shell out money for a mini. also doesn&#39;t require you to necessarily be on a Mac and it&#39;s probably the most safe option as well.
(02:18) For today&#39;s demo, I&#39;m going to be using Hostinger as the cloud provider. Three reasons for that. First one is just the bang for the buck, right? Seven bucks a month and I get plenty of power. Number two is it does give us a one-click install option with OpenClaw that I&#39;m going to show you.
(02:33)  And then third, once we&#39;re actually on that cloud server, we can get root access, which is important when we&#39;re setting up things like Gogg to actually get our Google authentication working. As for which plane you should use, KVM2 is plenty of power. You can get away with KVM1 as well.
(02:47)  Now, once we&#39;re here, the biggest thing you need to pay attention to is which operating system you&#39;re going to use. We going to use Ubuntu, and you&#39;re going to do 24.04 LTS. So, make sure you confirm this. From there, you&#39;re just going to hit continue and go through the payment process. Now, you may see some links or options about automatically deploying OpenClaw on your server.
(03:06)  I suggest not selecting that, especially if you&#39;re following this video, because I&#39;m going to show you instead how to go in the terminal and install this manually. We want to do that so we can actually give OpenClaw root access to this server we&#39;re creating in the cloud. It&#39;s going to be easier for us to install GOG, which will make it easier for us to actually get the Google credentials up and running on our claw agent.
(03:27)  Now, during your setup process, it will ask you for a root password. Make sure you remember this root password because we will be using it when we start working in the terminal. Now, once you finish up the setup, you&#39;re going to see a page that looks like this. And what I want you to pay attention to is this, the root access.
(03:44)  This command right here is what we&#39;re going to take into our own terminal to SSH into our cloud server. Now, what is SSH? What does that mean? Well, it&#39;s like using our terminal to then control the terminal for OpenClaw. That&#39;s all we&#39;re essentially doing. Now, we do have a terminal up here inside of Hostinger, but it&#39;s kind of cumbersome to every time we want to use the terminal here to open up Hostinger, go to this page, turn up this terminal.
(04:06) Like, I&#39;d rather just do it on my terminal, right? And it&#39;s very simple to do. So, what I want you to do is to copy this and then bring up your own terminal. So, once you&#39;re inside your terminal, just paste that in there. It&#39;s going to ask you this question. Hit yes. Put in your root password that you just set. And there you go.
(04:22)  It should now say root at your actual VPS address. Now it&#39;s time to actually install OpenClaw. Now some people might say, &quot;Hey, do we really want to do this as the root user?&quot; Ultimately, this VPS out in the cloud, all it&#39;s doing is OpenClaw. So I don&#39;t really see it as a security issue, seeing as this is the only thing on there.
(04:41)  This isn&#39;t our personal computer that we&#39;re running as root installing OpenClaw. Now it&#39;s time to install OpenClaw. So if you head to OpenClaw.ai, scroll down to quick start, it will give us the command we need to use. Now it&#39;s going to start on Windows. is we want this to be on MacOSS/ Linux. We&#39;re going to copy this. Head back to our terminal.
(05:01)  Paste this in there. And it&#39;s going to start installing. Yes, we understand it&#39;s risky. When it asks for what onboarding mode, do quick start. Here&#39;s where it&#39;s going to ask for your model/ provider. Now, understand a lot of people suggest anthropic. Anthropic is expensive, right? Everything that OpenCloud does is on a token basis and it can be rather tokenheavy.
(05:22)  So your cost can rack up pretty quickly and Anthropic I don&#39;t think is necessarily the best tool for the job unless you have no problem spending a bunch of money on tokens. My suggestion is using something a little bit cheaper. Maybe start with like an OpenAI model, maybe like a mini model because you can always go back and change this, right? You can always change what models are available to you.
(05:42) So for me, I&#39;m going to use OpenAI. If you don&#39;t know how to find your API key for any one of these, guess what? Just ask AI. It&#39;ll walk you through it. Next, it&#39;s going to ask the channel. This is what messaging app you want to use to actually talk with Open Claw. Now, I suggest using Telegram unless you have a preference for the others because Telegram&#39;s super easy to set up and it&#39;s free.
(06:02)  So, to get your Telegram bot token, what you&#39;re going to do is you&#39;re going to open Telegram and you&#39;re going to start a conversation with the bot father. From there, it&#39;s going to ask you a series of questions, namely, what do you want to name your bot? And then it&#39;s going to give you a token. It&#39;s going to say, &quot;Use this token to access the HTTP API.
(06:18) &quot; You&#39;re going to copy that token and you&#39;re going to paste it in here. It&#39;s going to ask if you want to configure skills. Now, we can say yes. Go homebrew install command. No. Now, this is asking you what skills you want to install right off the bat. Now, since we&#39;re on a VPS and we&#39;re not on a Mac OS, we&#39;re not going to be able to install a lot of these right away until we install some dependencies on our actual server.
(06:37)  But, one we can install right away is Claw Hub. So, you can just select that one and then hit enter. No. No. If you want to, you can set these up right now if you want to. You can always do them later. It&#39;s very simple. And it&#39;s going to ask if you want to enable hooks. And you can select all three of these and hit enter.
(06:52)  Now it&#39;s going to ask where do we want to hatch our bot. We&#39;re going to hatch in the T UI. We&#39;re really not going to mess with the web UI very much today. And with that, Clawbot is now installed on our VPS. First things it&#39;s going to ask you is like, do you want to give me a name or any sort of like personality type instructions? Go ahead and do that now.
(07:08)  And then what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll connect it to Telegram so we can talk to it there. Now, to get your bot working inside of Telegram, just click the link that botfather gave you to start that conversation. It&#39;ll bring you to a new window. You may see something at the bottom that says hit like start to start the bot.
(07:21)  But all you have to do is message it. So, just say hi. And you&#39;ll get a response that looks like this. Go ahead and just copy that entire message. Dump it into OpenClaw and say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m trying to set up Telegram. Here&#39;s the message I just got.&quot; And it&#39;s that easy to set it up. Now, I can open up Telegram and say, &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot; And I&#39;ll then get a response inside of Telegram.
(07:40)  You can also see that that response is mirrored inside of the terminal. But now I no longer need to talk to OpenClaw inside of the terminal. I can do everything inside of Telegram or Slack or WhatsApp or whatever it is I configured. And really the great value in OpenClaw I think is what you just saw there how easy it is to connect it to different things.
(08:01)  Right? All I did was I spoke to it, right? Compare that with like an automation where we would create it with a personal assistant. I&#39;d have to go in there and I&#39;d have to create the module to have to set up the credentials. Here with OpenClaw, a lot of that&#39;s kind of abstracted away. I just need to speak to it.
(08:15)  So, OpenClaw is now installed on the VPS. We can talk to it through Telegram. Now comes the fun part, actually hooking it up to Google. Now, this is sort of a multi-step process to do this. First, we&#39;re going to head to Google Workspace. We&#39;re going to give our agent its own email. We&#39;re going to connect it to the appropriate APIs.
(08:31)  Then, we&#39;re going to come back to our VPS, hop into the terminal. We&#39;re going to install the Gogg CLI. Go. This is the tool that allows OpenClaw and Google to actually communicate because unfortunately it is it isn&#39;t as easy as it was with Telegram where we can just talk to OpenClaw and have it do itself.
(08:48)  After we do that, we&#39;re going to authenticate all of our accounts and then we&#39;ll test it out and see if it&#39;s actually working as it should. So, a lot of moving parts, but we&#39;re going to go through it step by step so you can follow along. So, the first thing we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to head to Gmail and we&#39;re going to create a new email for our agent.
(09:05) Now, this is a level of separation that&#39;s meant to introduce some safety, right? If I want Open Claw to send emails, I don&#39;t want it to do it with my email address, right? I don&#39;t necessarily want my name and everything in my account just at its fingertips. Also, by having its own email and having its own accounts, it can still interact with us, right? It can still take a look at our calendar.
(09:25)  I can add it to the calendar. I can still give it access to my Google Drive. I can specify specific folders, right? This is the idea of least privilege, right? I don&#39;t want to give it everything because it might want to use it. We&#39;re going to start small. Now, the one caveat to this is, hey, what if I do want it to look at my inbox? Well, that can be kind of complicated.
(09:46)  And you can indeed give it access to your account if that&#39;s what you want to do. Just go into these decisions like that with your eyes wide open and understanding what&#39;s at risk because we don&#39;t have to risk everything if we don&#39;t want to. So, go ahead, create the account and we&#39;ll move on to the next step, which is the workspace.
(10:01) Now, I&#39;ve said workspace like 900 times, but what I&#39;m really talking about is we now need to move to the Google Cloud. So, it&#39;s console.cloud.google. Again, I&#39;ll put a link down below. What you need to make sure is that you&#39;re on your agents email account. So, if you come up here to the top right, make sure that the account it&#39;s associated with is the bots account.
(10:20) It&#39;s not yours. If you need to switch it, just click on the name and switch accounts. Next, I want you to create a new project. So, click my first project up here. Do new project. Call it whatever you want. I&#39;m going to call mine test one. Call it open cloth. Doesn&#39;t really matter.
(10:33)  Now, after you create that new project, you need to switch to it. It won&#39;t automatically do that. And once you&#39;re switched to it, it&#39;ll show it right here. Now, it&#39;s time to enable all the APIs. So, click this menu over here on the left. Go to APIs and services, enabled APIs and services. And then we&#39;re just going to go down the list.
(10:50)  So, you can either go down the list here or you can just do it in the search bar. So, for example, search for Gmail. You&#39;ll see Gmail API. Enable it. Once it&#39;s enabled, now I&#39;m going to want to do something like the Drive API, Google Drive API. And we&#39;re just going to repeat this process for all the APIs you want or need.
(11:07)  Google has a billion of them. At the very least, I suggest doing Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Gmail. And once you&#39;ve enabled all the APIs you want, go to the OOTH consent screen on the left hand side. You&#39;ll see a page like this and hit get started. For your app name, call whatever you want.
(11:23)  Use an email that you have access to. Hit next. For audience, we&#39;re going to do external. Contact information. Again, just put whatever email you want and create. Next, go to audience and I&#39;m going to want you go to publish app, hit confirm, and you&#39;re all set there. Next, go back to the navigation menu, the three bars on the left.
(11:46)  Go to APIs and services, and go to credentials. Go to create credentials over here and do OOTH client ID. Application type, we&#39;re going to do desktop app. Call it whatever you want and hit create. Now take note of your client ID and client secret. Copy those, put them somewhere secure because you won&#39;t see them again.
(12:06)  But what you also need to do is you need to download the JSON. Once you downloaded the JSON and you recorded the ID and secret, you can hit okay. Now what we need to do is we need to take that JSON file and we need to put it inside our VPS that has all of our credentials and that&#39;s what OpenClaw is going to be able to use to actually connect our Google accounts.
(12:26)  So for this next step, we need to be in the terminal. So open up a new terminal window and paste in this command. Now what are we doing here? This is us taking our downloaded JSON file and copying it onto our VPS. So I&#39;m going to give you this command, but you&#39;re going to have to change some stuff, right? What are you going to have to change? This whole blue part you&#39;re going to need to change because this blue section, that is my downloaded path to that JSON file we just got from Google.
(12:53) Okay. How do you find that path? Just right click on the file inside your download folder and do copy as path. Also, you&#39;ll need to change this. Right? This is my VPS servers IP. Yours will be different. If you&#39;re confused of how to change these things, just copy this command that I&#39;m giving you.
(13:10)  Bring it to AI. Explain what you&#39;re trying to do. It will adjust it for you. That&#39;s my best advice. It&#39;s going to ask for your root password when you do that. And then it&#39;s just going to copy it over. Now, at this point, we do want to SSH back into our VPS. So go ahead, head to hostinger and grab that command.
(13:25)  And let&#39;s just confirm that our file is actually there. So we can see here that the file does exist and was copied over. Now it&#39;s time to actually install GOG. So you&#39;re just going to paste in all these commands which are again in the school. And you&#39;re going to let it go to work for a couple minutes.
(13:39)  Now at the end of all that, you should see something that looks like this where it&#39;s like v0.9.0.5. Basically, you can just run go space- version. And if you get something that shows an actual version, well, hey, congratulations. Gogg is now installed. So go ahead and clear this out. So we&#39;ve now installed Gogg.
(13:58)  Now we need to authenticate our credentials with Gogg. So this is our next command. And this is by far the most confusing and challenging part of this entire setup. And it&#39;s where everybody gets lost. So this command looks simple enough, right? Google off add. And you&#39;re going to put your particular email.
(14:13)  The services you&#39;re going to put here. The one inside the school will include additional services. Trim this down to whatever APIs you actually enabled. For me, it was Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. When I run this command, it&#39;s going to return a gigantic link. I need to follow that link to authenticate my account.
(14:28)  Problem is, we&#39;re on this VPS. When I follow that link, it&#39;s not it&#39;s going to bring up the browser on my computer, which means it won&#39;t work. So, to get it to work, we need to essentially route it in a different direction to our computer. So, to do that, you need to create a second terminal window right on your local computer.
(14:48)  And there is a specific command you&#39;re going to need to give it. That command depends on the giant link we get here. So I can&#39;t tell you what exactly it&#39;s going to look like. You have to pick out a a series of numbers in that giant link. To make this easy, what you&#39;re going to do is you&#39;re going to have another window open with a large language model.
(15:09)  In this case, it&#39;s clawed. It doesn&#39;t matter what it is, but you&#39;re going to have this prompt in there. It says I&#39;m setting up open claw on oinger. My VPS is this IP again. Where do you get this on this page IP right here? I just ran a go off ad command and got the URL with a port number.
(15:28)  I&#39;m going to paste the output. Give me the exact ssh tunnel command I need to run on my local computer with the correct port number filled in. What does that mean? Doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s going to give you a command that you need to copy and paste into the second window. confused? Totally okay. Just watch me do this and you&#39;re going to repeat it.
(15:49)  So, we&#39;re going to hit enter. Giant URL. We copy the URL. We paste the URL in here. It gives me the command. Copy. Go into the other terminal. Paste. Enter password. Now click the browser. Now choose your account advanced. Go to OC1. It&#39;s totally okay. Hit continue. Select all. Continue. Authorized. All right. A lot of moving parts.
(16:40)  That link doesn&#39;t stay up forever. So, if it expires, you&#39;re going to have to do that again. But that&#39;s the series of events you need to do. Okay. Hit enter. Copy the link. Go to AI. Paste the link. Copy command. Second terminal again on the local level. Paste in that command. Enter root password. Go back. Follow link. Next.
(17:04) Next. Next. Next. Confused? Great. Once you do that though, you&#39;re connected. You&#39;re set up. It&#39;s then going to ask for a passphrase. You can use any passphrase you want. And once you do that, you should then see your email pop up for your bot with the services that are provided.
(17:20)  Now, if you wanted to add more services, let&#39;s say later you wanted to add sheets or slides or something. You would just repeat that process we just did. You don&#39;t need to do the whole JSON thing. You just need to do the last round of commands we did, right? Where you do the URL, you do this whole double terminal thing.
(17:35)  Painful, but that&#39;s it. anytime you want to add commands, add services, that&#39;s how you would do it. So after we create that key ring password, we want to set that in ourv file so we&#39;re not always being asked for it every time we need to use these Google resources. So we&#39;re going to run this command which is going to open up nano.
(17:50)  It&#39;s going to take you to something that looks like this. We just want to hit the down arrow once. Go ahead and type go_key password equal sign and then you&#39;re just going to put in your keyring password. Once you put in your password to exit to save and exit this, you&#39;re going to do control O enter and then control X.
(18:10)  After you do that, we&#39;re going to run chmod 600 on this to lock it down. Now, after we run chmod, then we&#39;re going to run this final command. And that&#39;s going to make sure we aren&#39;t constantly asked for the keyring password when we&#39;re using Google. And at this point, everything should be connected.
(18:23)  So, let&#39;s run it through one final test inside the terminal to make sure we didn&#39;t miss anything. So, this is the command we&#39;re going to run again. Switch that email with your email. And you should get a bunch of stuff that looks like this. Essentially, it should be checking the email and all those other things to see if it actually got any hits back.
(18:40)  If it asks you for like your key ring again, that means you missed something in the EMV file and you probably need to go back the last couple minutes and just make sure you pasted all the commands in. And also, if you don&#39;t get your answer from there, just make sure you&#39;re copying and pasting this into your AI of choice and being like, hey, like what&#39;s going wrong here? Now, if everything in that last step worked for you, as it did for me, now there&#39;s one more thing we need to do while we&#39;re still inside the
(19:02) terminal. And we essentially now have to give OpenClaw access to that Google keyring. And to do that, we&#39;re going to have to hop into Nano again. So, we&#39;re going to run this command. Once inside nano, you&#39;re going to go down to where it says services, and we&#39;re going to create a new environmental variable essentially.
(19:22)  So, we&#39;ll do environment equals Then just like we did before, go hearing password equals and then you&#39;re going to put your password in there again and then control O entertrl + x. Next, we need to restart the system. So we&#39;re going to put in these two commands. And now openclaw should finally be ready to go. So now let&#39;s actually test it out.
(19:44) So I told OpenClaw Gogg and your Google accounts are set up. Send an email to me at my email. I gave him my email saying what&#39;s up and send a calendar invite for 2 p.m. tomorrow and let&#39;s have a chat. and it came back and told me well what time zone how long. Um so we&#39;ll tell it told it hey use CST 30 minutes primary calendar use a link and get creative now all these sorts of things like these default settings that it&#39;s asking for.
(20:08) You can actually just have back and forth with open claw and just say hey going forward remember it&#39;s always CST remember this is my email because remember again it essentially has like a pretty robust rag system under the hood as well as a bunch of markdown files to both remember its chats and remember specific essentially character traits that you give it.
(20:28)  So, it says it sent the email. So, let&#39;s see if it actually did it. All right. So, I got the email from my bot saying what&#39;s up. And I also got the calendar invite. Pretty sweet. Now, speaking of calendars, what you can also do at this point is you can go into your personal calendars and you can invite OpenClaw and whatever email address you get it to be able to view your calendar.
(20:48)  So, when you start talking to your bot, in my case, Maya, and I say, &quot;Hey, take a look at my calendar tomorrow and see what times are available.&quot; It can actually do that, right? Right? And those are the sort of ways that you can essentially give it access to say your calendar. It can view it, but you&#39;re not giving it necessarily like root access to your calendar, right? It can&#39;t edit events and stuff, but it can still take a look and adjust things as needed.
(21:08)  That&#39;s the nice thing with giving it its email because, hey, it can still add things to your calendar via invites versus again having full access to your complete digital life and changing things on the spot. So, this is where we&#39;re going to wrap up for today. Like you saw, it&#39;s actually kind of painful to get Google set up with OpenClaw.
(21:26)  Even though it&#39;s a very intuitive tool and once it is up and running, it&#39;s very easy to add things to it. Google is one of the exceptions, which kind of sucks because having access to the email, the calendar, and all these things is really, really important if we truly want to turn this into an AI assistant that&#39;s actually useful.
(21:44)  And in terms of usefulness and about all the hype with Claudebot, just understand what this is and what it isn&#39;t. What it is is a very intuitive, very powerful personal assistant. But truth be told, a lot of things that it can do are things that if you stripped away and just did in a vacuum, like specific automations and cron jobs and scheduling things, you&#39;ve been able to do inn and other places for a long long time.
(22:07)  I think the real value with open claw is the manner in which it&#39;s been packaged and the foundation it&#39;s laying for what can be built upon it in the next year or two. right now in its current iteration. Again, very useful. But the things it&#39;s actually doing aren&#39;t particularly novel, nor are they things that we couldn&#39;t do before.
(22:24)  It&#39;s just all in one place now, and we can talk to it on Telegram, which also we could do before as well. But all that to say, I&#39;m not trying to like knock OpenClaw. It&#39;s an awesome tool. Just is it, you know, is it necessarily new what it&#39;s doing? No. But it&#39;s packaged in a very special way, which is really what I think the discussion should be about because that&#39;s where the real value lies.
(22:45)  The real value isn&#39;t telling it to, you know, send me an email, although that is important if an AI assistant is what you want. So, as always, let me know what you thought in the comments and you can stay on the lookout for more OpenClaw videos, right? Hopefully, this has sort of laid the foundation so we can actually start doing cool stuff with it. And as always, I&#39;ll see you
