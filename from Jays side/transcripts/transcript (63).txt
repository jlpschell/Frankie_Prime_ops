(00:00) Andrew, you got to see this. It is so simple, dead simple to connect OpenClaw securely to over 8,000 apps. And in just a few minutes, few clicks, you got 8,000 apps connected to OpenClaw. This is making OpenClaw way more powerful than it was straight out of the box. &gt;&gt; Rex Harris is the senior product manager MCP at Zapier.
(00:23) &gt;&gt; Presented by Zapier, the AI automation company. I gave my AI agent access to my notion doc and it deleted the whole database I gave it access to. And with notion, you can&#39;t unddelete a lot at once. You have to unddelete each one individually. Frustrating. I went to give it access to Gmail and it took forever to go through all the requirements to get it on Gmail.
(00:44)  This is the problem with connecting individual apps to OpenClaw or any other software. And Zapier has a solution. one connection and you get it access to all the apps and you give it only the permission that you want, you&#39;re going to see something amazing right now. &gt;&gt; Rex, give me an example of how you&#39;re using all these connections with OpenClaw.
(01:05) &gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. So, um, what you&#39;re seeing here is actually a the Slack workspace of an AI community that I run here in Pittsburgh called AI work. So, when I&#39;m not, you know, in the trenches with my, you know, MCP team at Zapier, um, I&#39;m running this community. And here&#39;s an example of a sort of like task that I need to take on um for the community that I&#39;m going to take from Slack directly.
(01:29)  I&#39;m going to grab this link and what I&#39;m going to do is turn this into a linear task ticket. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And so the way I would do that is from uh from Slack itself um sending it over to OpenClaw. We&#39;ll get into that. But first, what I&#39;m using is our product Zapier MCP. Um, this makes it super simple to connect OpenClaw or essentially any AI app to 8,000 plus apps and, you know, over like 90,000 different actions.
(02:00)  So, pretty wild, but only takes a few minutes. I&#39;ve already have it set up here, but I&#39;ll kind of walk you through. You can see for our community, we use a number of different services. We use Google, Type Form, Slack, Linear, um, and Loops for for CRM and and email. &gt;&gt; Okay. And and when I see numbers next to linear, so linear is one of the connections that you now are giving open claw access to.
(02:24)  And these are the powers that it has. It can&#39;t do everything. It can only do the things that you specifically picked for it to be able to do in linear, the project management software. &gt;&gt; Yeah, good call out because there&#39;s certain scenarios or apps where you don&#39;t want to give OpenClaw all of the power to let&#39;s say like delete or um you know, send messages.
(02:44)  For instance, Slack, I still prefer to write my Slack messages old school um by hand. &gt;&gt; Uh so in the um interface here, you can choose only the Slack actions that are gathering data. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um and you know restrict anything that would actually write. &gt;&gt; Okay, that&#39;s the that&#39;s the wonderful part about this.
(03:05)  And of course, whatever you&#39;re doing here, you can then give to Open Claw and other tools also. Okay. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So like notion, you know, you could just do just the find data or take action tools and you can lock that down or you can just do, you know, specific one by one and then you uh connect those. &gt;&gt; Okay.
(03:23)  Show me how to create a connection like this from scratch. You have all of these connections. How do I create one from scratch? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. So it&#39;s super simple. Go to new MCP server. Right now for openclaw, you&#39;re going to use the other option here. Um we are going to be uh adding open claw as one of these sort of default clients.
(03:44)  Um but right now other then you just very simply go ahead and add tools for instance you can just connect all those and then you know you can do that for any of the apps across you know our ecosystem. We have over 8,000. Uh then &gt;&gt; so let me so Gmail you didn&#39;t have to go through the reauthentication with Gmail because you&#39;d already connected it before to Zapier. Got it. Got it. Okay.
(04:08) All right. Um and then &gt;&gt; like notion I think notion if I did connect I would have to choose an account. &gt;&gt; Um so you know that&#39;d be something because I hadn&#39;t set that up yet. &gt;&gt; Okay. Otherwise you&#39;re just using OOTH to connect and it&#39;s as easy as authorizing. Okay.
(04:24)  Can you do linear here? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Let&#39;s see linear. &gt;&gt; So linear. &gt;&gt; Okay. What I want to see is the options that you&#39;re then selecting. Got it. Find customer by ID. I don&#39;t know that that would matter to me. F. Do you ever use find customer by ID? Probably not. &gt;&gt; Honestly, I just select them all.
(04:40) &gt;&gt; What about deleting? Is there is that one of the options that you could select or or unselect? &gt;&gt; Uh deleting for so for linear deleting I think is updating an issue um is you know that actually has the delete option here. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So you could you could you know switch this off if for linear specifically you&#39;re worried about that action.
(05:01)  But um linear I think generally you know it&#39;s okay to you know I feel comfortable with both but again you have this option of just doing find data or take action like these. &gt;&gt; All right you might as well do all if you&#39;re comfortable with it. I just I just want to know where I my comfort line is. Let&#39;s go to Gmail for a moment.
(05:18) Where I&#39;m not comfortable with Gmail is I think you selected all options. Right. &gt;&gt; I did. &gt;&gt; But if you wanted to instead of sending email Yeah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yep. I could remove this. I could have just not also added it to begin with. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; what&#39;s nice about Gmail that I use all the time is I&#39;ll have it uh create a draft, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So create draft is, you know, not going to be destructive.
(05:43)  Uh but you know, we just literally removed send email as an option. &gt;&gt; Perfect. So now if there&#39;s someone that I want to email, I can say send an email to this person via Telegram. It will create a draft for me, but it won&#39;t hit send so that I can read it, make sure it&#39;s not weird, edit it myself. Beautiful. Okay, this is how you add it.
(05:59) Now, let&#39;s see how you give this connection to um open claw. Is that the next step? &gt;&gt; Yes. So, you go to connect. Um you would few you know clicks here. You&#39;re basically just like creating an off token. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh you will and you know we&#39;ll obviously change this uh in post.
(06:20)  I&#39;ll delete this but um you&#39;re just going to copy this. And then the other thing that you&#39;ll do is um you can just highlight all this, copy it, and then one of the beauties of open claw is that you can just kind of like give it as much context as possible &gt;&gt; and it&#39;ll you know kind of figure it out on its own. &gt;&gt; Okay.
(06:41)  And when you select it all, even the text in the copy paste box, the input boxes got selected. Okay. So you&#39;re just copying everything. Let&#39;s see how you give it to Yeah. &gt;&gt; to open claw. Okay. Okay. You can see my uh freshly created Telegram group topic for this conversation. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, &gt;&gt; and essentially this is just a conversation between you and your main agent.
(07:10)  You just happen to pop it into a separate group so we don&#39;t see all the past conversations you had. &gt;&gt; Sort of. Uh this is a sub agent. &gt;&gt; Oh. in Open Claw. One of the nice sort of benefits of using Telegram um groups is that when you have subtopics in a group, each one is its own sub agent and then I have like a main agent up here.
(07:35) &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. I&#39;ve done that. So, did you create one just for us? &gt;&gt; I did. &gt;&gt; Okay. Great. All right. So, now you&#39;re Let&#39;s see how you tell it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I&#39;m just grabbed all that. You know, I could have also done a screenshot. Um, and then I&#39;m going to say here&#39;s the credentials and that I will give here.
(08:01) Okay. So, what I forgot to give it is some instruction uh of actually Okay. Can you connect to this? MCP and let me know when we&#39;re ready to use it. My OpenClaw bot is named Disco. You can see &gt;&gt; he&#39;s got like name Disco. &gt;&gt; Uh that was a dog name that we were always going to use and then we rescued a dog and it had a name already.
(08:39)  So I uh adopted it. Um or I I I co-opted it. The uh the fun thing is that sometimes when I&#39;m, you know, speaking with Disco, uh it&#39;ll actually use emoji reactions to my message and it&#39;ll be a little disco ball which actually animates. Uh one cool thing also, you can see um Disco is typing.
(09:05)  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed that with yours. &gt;&gt; I love that. It&#39;s it&#39;s one of the things that really makes Telegram helpful that I can see that it&#39;s working. Okay. So, connected and look, it shows all the tools that we added. &gt;&gt; Ah, yes. So, now it knows. All right. So, now let&#39;s take that Slack message that you had before.
(09:23) &gt;&gt; Hey, do that. I&#39;m going to say turn this into a task inside of linear assigned to me. &gt;&gt; And it now knows to use the MCP server. That&#39;s what it&#39;s called, right? MCP server. &gt;&gt; Correct. Yeah. Model context protocol. &gt;&gt; Okay. I hate that it&#39;s called MCP. It makes it sound so much more complicated than it is.
(09:51)  It would &gt;&gt; agreed. &gt;&gt; If it was just like a connection friend or I don&#39;t know what it would have felt like a lot easier. &gt;&gt; I think the the industry will converge on a more uh sort of userfriendly term very soon. Um but I think it&#39;s served its purpose you know uh for for the time being. &gt;&gt; Okay. So it got the message.
(10:16)  Now it&#39;s going to create a linear task. [music] And there you go. &gt;&gt; Okay. Click it. This is the task that it created. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I&#39;m going to open this. And there it is. &gt;&gt; One minute. Let me see. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, invite feature launch ideal new member criteria source. &gt;&gt; It even knew to give the Slack source, which I really like.
(10:45)  That&#39;s a decision it made for you. &gt;&gt; Correct. And it and it signed it to me. &gt;&gt; Okay. I&#39;m going to ask you to do one more thing. &gt;&gt; Put you on the spot. &gt;&gt; Since you said that it will work faster the second time, let&#39;s come back in to disco and say, &quot;Disco, remind me to get a haircut.
(11:03) &quot; &gt;&gt; Okay. or add add haircut reminder to linear. Let&#39;s see it on the screen when you&#39;re doing it too. &gt;&gt; Okay. My community is going to wonder why there is a haircut task. &gt;&gt; Oh, because they can see the tasks. Okay. &gt;&gt; It&#39;s all good. It&#39;s all good. Nice. Can you create a to-do item to get a haircut next week for me? Now, let&#39;s see.
(11:37) I do agree the I didn&#39;t ask it to link back to the original Slack message. It just assumed you know kind of took the um its own agency to some degree um to you know include that information. &gt;&gt; Part of it I noticed is it getting to know us. In the beginning, it would not give me links to things.
(11:59)  And I, as someone who interviews, need links to sources all the time. And the more I work with it, the more it knows Andrew is always gonna want a source. I&#39;m going to give it a source. &gt;&gt; Um, to the point where I think sometimes it even goes out of its way to find a really bad source just so it has a link and fulfills the obligation.
(12:15)  But I&#39;ll take it over. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. I do think, you know, you and I were talking, you know, ahead of time about, you know, making sure to give it that feedback and then it should uh update, you know, the files it uses to essentially, you know, guide the discussions it has with you. And there you go.
(12:35) &gt;&gt; Okay. One more thing &gt;&gt; because you&#39;re going to leave this, &gt;&gt; have it sent since you did use Gmail, you did connect it to Gmail, right? &gt;&gt; Um, I have it connected to Gmail. How do you feel about me putting you on the spot again and saying create a draft email to Andrew subject thank you and thank him for recording this interview with me and Andrew use my email address in case it doesn&#39;t know it and it shouldn&#39;t know it.
(13:03)  Can you do that? &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh I think so. Create a draft email to Andrew &gt;&gt; at the next thing.ai at the next thing.ai. AI saying thank you for this interview. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Okay. And now let&#39;s look at the linear while while that&#39;s happening. &gt;&gt; Great. And this is the first time I&#39;ve ever used linear &gt;&gt; for a haircut &gt;&gt; to schedule myself a haircut.
(13:40)  [laughter] &gt;&gt; I suggested it because I&#39;m definitely in need of a haircut. Um, [laughter] &gt;&gt; well played. Well played. Okay, let&#39;s check Gmail. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yep. Okay, there you go. &gt;&gt; Just want to say thank you. &gt;&gt; And it wrote the whole thing for you. Just wanted to send a thank you note to say thank you for uh taking the time to chat today. This is great.
(14:01)  This is amazing. &gt;&gt; And I had it&#39;s a draft so you can see it&#39;s in drafts. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um you must have thought I was ridiculous when I scheduled an hour of time for us to go through this. This took basically like 4 minutes to set up and then I spent some extra time asking for details. This is amazingly fast.
(14:20) &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s uh what a time to be alive as they say. Um but also you know power obviously you know the product we we work on but you know Zapier MCCP just makes it super simple and not just for openclaw for you know any AI app that you use &gt;&gt; everything because what happens is I have to with every app that I use whether it&#39;s clawed or open claw or clawed code or whatever I have to keep going back and reauthenticating and I&#39;m giving the exact same permissions and it&#39;s a drag to think about what I need
(14:50) where what I want to do is just do one and done this is it zap your mc PP Rex, thanks so much for doing this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, my pleasure. Thank you, Andrew.
