(00:00) So, a few weeks ago, I saw a strategy when I was just doom scrolling social media one night laying in bed, and it got me thinking, does it actually work? So, I decided to take the transcript from that video, build it into a strategy, and back test it to see if it would in fact be profitable. So, let me explain to you what it is, how it works, and show you the results.
(00:20)  I&#39;ve actually traded this before, but I had never back tested it. It had always been kind of hit or miss and it was one of those if the opening range break that I use on ES didn&#39;t present itself, I would just take a look at this one because the time frame happens after. So is what it is is you take NQ or MNQ, you mark out the 9:30 to 945, 15minute opening range, the top wick to the bottom wick of that 15minute candle.
(00:44)  You then switch down to the 5minut time frame and all you&#39;re waiting for is a fiveminut candle body closure to be above or below the zone. And it doesn&#39;t have to be the whole candle. It just has to be part of the body. It can&#39;t wick out and then pop back in and then chop around. It has to be a candle body closure of some kind above or below the zone.
(01:06)  And then you just simply go in that direction. So I did it a few times, passed a couple evaluation accounts, moved on to funded accounts. I was just messing around with it on Apex and it worked. But now I want to see is it profitable long-term. So let me show you the results. So you guys can see here I am on MNQ and I basically you can already see I have this mapped out right here.
(01:27)  So I&#39;ll zoom in because essentially this is how it works. This is where the strategy is picking this up. This is the 15minute range right here. And this closure on this candle body is above this zone. I really have to zoom in so you can see it. But as we get closer you can see the candle body is above the zone and then it kicks over to the next 5minute candle and then of course it pulls back.
(01:50)  But is how I did this and built this strategy was I set a certain number of contracts. You can see here this is the you can adjust the opening range to whatever you want to back test or whatever I want to back test. And my stop-loss method I went through and fine-tuned this. So I have it all the way at the opposite side of the zone.
(02:09)  I know that&#39;s a massive stop-loss. I know that it&#39;s hundreds of points. So it&#39;s crazy. But on MNQ, you can do it if you have the account that will allow for it. You could also do it off the midpoint, do it off an ATR, or just off of a fixed point if you want to be really specific. But I&#39;m just doing opposite side.
(02:27)  I am running five contracts, and then I have my TP1 and two at one point and 1.5 and scaling out contracts as it goes. So, this one right here enters in, stop losses all the way down here. Gives it plenty of room to breathe. And you can see it comes all the way out. We didn&#39;t even hit TP1 because this range is so massive.
(02:47)  Price didn&#39;t move that aggressive, but we still ended in profit on this day. Right here, you can see candle breaks below on a 5m minute and closes. So, the short is fired and it enters in right here. Kicks over and then almost comes back and loses it again. I know the stop loss is crazy, but is what it is.
(03:04)  It works for my account. And then right here, we actually lost money this day. Here&#39;s a good winning day, though. Right here, a short. This was on February 4th, so last Wednesday. Candle breaks below the bottom of the zone on a 5minute and right here it enters, kicks around, touches the midpoint, and runs all the way down to my TP.
(03:23)  So, let me stop showing you this because what you really want to see are the actual results of the back test. So, let&#39;s go ahead and take a look at it. Let&#39;s start right here over the last year. So February 8th of 2025 to current $43,000 P&amp;L equity draw down of 12,400 454 trades. The profitable trades 56.17% and a profit factor of 1.369.
(03:49)  So that&#39;s going back a full 12 months using this strategy. And there is as well in this strategy a way to if for example the reason why there would be more trades at 454 is some of these days there are duplicates because they drop really hard it&#39;s going to be hard for me to find one but sometimes this TP hits all the way and then it comes back into the zone and when it rebreass again if we are not in a trade it re-triggers again so that&#39;s why there is more than uh what would be available on the trading days is because
(04:19) some days there&#39;s duplicates. So this is the last one year. I&#39;m going to split the difference here and let&#39;s go back and look at August one to current. So we get a six-month because there&#39;s no preset on here for that. Sixmonth is fairly consistent. Still a pretty decent size draw down though, but 17,977.
(04:35) Total trades of 228, 56.14% profitable with a 1.297 profit factor. Now let&#39;s look at the last 90 days. You can see right here again draw down still a concern. Total trades 102, but you have a almost a 58% win rate, profit factor of 1.3. Now, this also could get better as well by me coming in here, adjusting my contracts, adjusting my takeprofits.
(05:01)  I could fine-tune this better. I just put this together, set it as an example, and I I just wanted to start playing around with it. So, I&#39;m going to fine-tune this to get it better. And this also is just on MNQ. Going to make a variation for NQ and then MEES and ES. I&#39;m going to change the time frames, but again, this is just I built it this weekend and I was clicking around numbers and I wanted to show you guys because it&#39;s pretty cool.
(05:20) When you&#39;re over a 50% win rate, keep in mind institutions say their best traders win somewhere between 55 and 60% and most institutional traders land between 51 and 55% on their win rates. So, if you&#39;re even in that realm somewhere and you have the right risk management, you&#39;re actually trading at level.
(05:39)  They say what institutions do. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the truth, but 51 to 55% for most institutional traders is pretty good. If you as a retail trader are around that same mark, you honestly can&#39;t really ask for much more than that. So, that&#39;s the last 90 days. Let&#39;s look at the last 30. Last 30 is crazy.
(05:54) Total P&amp;L 17,000. Max equity draw down 3,700. 33 trades. 81.82% profitable with a profit factor of 4.197. Incredible. Then the last seven days, 85.71% win rate, $6,300 with a draw down of 3717, seven total trades, profit factor of 4.492. So I did that on MNQ. I also set it up on MEES to take a look as well.
(06:26)  So this is MNQ. You can see here that when this mark out the 15minute range top to bottom on the first 15-minute candle from 9:30 to 9:45 then let the first five minute candle body close outside of the zone whether it be above or below and then simply go in that direction. Again, I&#39;ll recap.
(06:44)  I know I already did it twice. I know the stop loss is crazy. I know that it&#39;s all the way on the other side. I know that&#39;s not going to work for everybody. But for the people it does work for, great. If that doesn&#39;t work for you and that&#39;s not your trading style, that&#39;s also not my problem. So, this is how I&#39;m going to run it.
(06:58)  So, now this is MEES, which smaller cost. So, I&#39;m running more contracts. I actually have 10 on this one. So, let me show you the settings for this. This again is the same exact thing. 9:30 first 15 minutes going off the opposite side of the opening range. And I have the TP1 at 7 and the TP2 at 1.4.
(07:21)  So, again, I&#39;m still fine-tuning it to make it better. But you can see here, same exact thing applies. you didn&#39;t technically have a candle body close outside of the zone out of the top. Uh right here it&#39;s close, but you did right here and then it runs and it goes. So, same thing here. We had this pretty much the same results on MEES and MNQ, but our scaling is different and our contracts are different.
(07:42)  So, let&#39;s look at the report for the last 365 days, February 8th of 2025 to current. Today, 33,000 on the P&amp;L, draw down of 12,21 trades, profit win rate at 59.48% 48% with a profit factor of 1.2. Also, one thing to note on this strategy, the reason why this is higher as well is because this is your entry. This counts as a trade. That&#39;s an exit.
(08:04)  So, it&#39;s a signal. So, that counts as a trade. And then right here is another exit. So, in total off of this right here, you would have more than one trade accounted for. That&#39;s also why these numbers are higher because you&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, there wasn&#39;t 501 trading days in the last 365 days. It&#39;s not possible.
(08:21) &quot; But each one of these exits actually counts as a trade as well the way the strategy works. So I know these numbers look a little bit different, but that&#39;s why some days there&#39;s only one, some days there&#39;s three, or well, I guess every day there would be two at least. But um some days there&#39;s three, some days there&#39;s four.
(08:35) So anyways, over the last 365 days, almost a 60% win rate with a profit factor of 1.269. Let&#39;s go back to August and we&#39;ll do the same thing. The sixmonth to current, not as attractive. $6,300 uh on the P&amp;L for the profit. 11,747. This obviously would be a challenge. 258 trades, 55.8% win rate with a 1.1 profit factor.
(08:59)  The last 90 days here, $7,000 on the P&amp;L, 11,747. Again, draw down still a concern. 120 trades, profitable trades though, 59.17% profit factor of 1.229. Last 30 days is beautiful. Total P&amp;L 12,155. your draw down at 2,950. 41 total trades for a 78% win rate and a profit factor of 2.926. And then the last seven is incredibly good as well. 88.
(09:30) 89% win rate, 5.25 profit factor, nine total trades for $5,900. And draw down is the same as the 30, 2,950. So, you had some movement, but all of these or at least these two that I&#39;ve looked at being over a 50% win rate over the last year, it&#39;s not something you can overlook, I think. And again, to reiterate, the strategy is just this right here.
(09:57)  You go to the 15minute time frame, you mark out the first 9:30 to 9:45 candle right here. 9:30 on the 15 minute marks out the top wick to the bottom wick. All you&#39;re waiting on then you go down to the five minute time frame. Wait for part of a candle body to close above or below the zone and then you&#39;re going in that direction.
(10:17)  So right here you get the close barely outside still counts. It kicks over. You enter in right here. It kicks over right here. You&#39;re entered. You get a little bit of a pullback and then it&#39;s off. Same thing back over here. This one chopped all day. Candle breaks out and closes. When the fivem minute closes, it kicks over.
(10:35) you&#39;re right here and then it chops through and you lost that day. This one right here though, just like on MNQ, five minute candle closes below, it kicks over, chops around, moves back up, pulls back into the zone, and then all the way down to your TP2 for 10 contract exit on MEES.
(10:54)  So that right there are some back tested 15minute opening range break orb strategies for you for the last 12 months.
