(00:00) So, I&#39;ve seen a certain influencer on social media all around on pretty much YouTube, Tik Tok, Instagram, all of them talking about his strategy. And you guys will probably know who it is. I&#39;m not going to say any names. I&#39;m just going to back test it. But basically, it starts out with, &quot;This is the only candle you&#39;ll ever need to become a profitable trader.
(00:22)  I made $100,000 in one month using this one simple day trading strategy. It&#39;s the slow talk, the listen to me, the whatever. I don&#39;t have any issue with the guy. I just back tested his strategy and uh it [ __ ] sucks. So, I&#39;m going to show you the results and we&#39;ll back test it for a year and uh then you tell me what you think. So, here&#39;s the strategy.
(00:47)  I have two different ones that I&#39;m going to do just in case for some reason I&#39;m not understanding exactly what he is saying his strategy is. But I&#39;m on MNQ. I&#39;ll test this on another ticker as well. But on MNQ, you come over to the 5minut time frame and I built this strategy out. So you mark out the first 5m minute candle in the New York session from 9:30 to 9:35.
(01:11)  You then drop down to the one minute time frame and essentially according to the strategy is you are looking for a fair value gap to present itself in the direction of the move and to be in the zone or breaking out of the zone and then that&#39;s your cue to go in. And I believe the video&#39;s changed. So I don&#39;t know if you set your stop loss at the top of the fair value gap or the other way would be the bottom.
(01:37)  But I&#39;m just going to set it to the midpoint because it sounds like the first one we&#39;re going to back test is that the fair value gap needs to be breaking through part of the zone, maybe continuing out. Again, I can&#39;t keep track of it because it changes whenever I see the video, but long and short of it is 9:30 to 9:35 5m minute candle.
(01:56) That&#39;s supposed to be the busiest 5 minutes of the entire trading window. You then get a fair value gap whether it&#39;s going short or long. in that direction. You set your stop loss, I believe fair value gap or midpoint and then go to your 2:1 reward to risk is how they calculate it.
(02:15)  Even though it&#39;s such a weird way to do it uh risk-to-reward a one to two doesn&#39;t matter. Um but let&#39;s back test it. So this is what it looks like uh right here in my strategy. And I&#39;m on MNQ. I believe I said that but MNQ here. Let me show you guys the settings I have too real quick just for I&#39;ll be as transparent as I can.
(02:36)  9:30 five minute time frame minimum fair value gap size I don&#39;t even have it requires an FVG to cross the level ratios targeting just one and stop loss is at a midpoint. Honestly, if you&#39;re targeting a 1:2 risk-to-reward, if you don&#39;t even have a good ratio hitting a one, you&#39;re not going to hit a two.
(02:56)  So, we&#39;ll go conservative at one. And I&#39;m just going to run it with one contract. I&#39;m going to keep this to see if I can tweak it to make it better, maybe with multiple contracts. But that&#39;s how I have it set right now to run. And I&#39;ll show you the results. So, one contract on MNQ the last 365 days from Feb 10 of 2025 to current day today. Loss of $2,45.
(03:20) Max draw down. At one point, your biggest loss would be 4,353. 168 trades. It&#39;s profitable 48% of the time and a profit factor of 898. I&#39;ll do the entire history just for fun because we&#39;re here over the entire life back since 1799 before everyone was alive. 55% win rate for a 1.036 profit factor.
(03:46) Biggest draw down at one point is 4353 for a total profit of 1626. So we&#39;ll go last 90 days. You would have lost almost three grand. 40% win rate, 6 profit factor. Last 30 days is 1772 loss with a max draw down of 2196 for almost 31% win rate, a profit factor of 0.4.
(04:14)  And then last 7 days hasn&#39;t hit a single trade. All you&#39;ve done is lose $1,400. So let me do another test. Let&#39;s just come here and instead of midpoint, let&#39;s go opposite side. Let&#39;s give this more room to breathe in case it needs some room to work just because since we&#39;re already on seven days, that changes it a little bit when it has more room to work.
(04:37)  Uh 33% win rate last 30 days, 46% win rate, you still lost $682. Last 90, 42% win rate, you lost $3,700. And then we&#39;ll just look at the last year. I&#39;m going to go test this on NQ as well. While we&#39;re here, I know I&#39;m on MNQ, but we should be fairly comparable, but over the last 365 days doing this to the opposite side of the zone, your draw down right back here, you&#39;re losing 8,000 plus dollars.
(05:02)  It just in one shot, and then you lost 2,700. So, let&#39;s check NQ and see. I know they&#39;re different. There&#39;s different volume and stuff like that. So, let me change this back to the original settings we had. I&#39;ll just go to the midpoint and we&#39;ll update it and see where we&#39;re at. This is for 365 days. Loss $28,000.
(05:22)  Your total loss at one point to its lowest valley $34,000 on a draw down. 166 trades. Profitable trades is almost 47% with a 0857. Profit factor the last 90 is 48 49% win rate. You lost 12,000. Last 30 days, you&#39;re still not making money. So, I see the videos and they get a lot of hype and it&#39;s like this is the only strategy you need to make money.
(05:53)  And I don&#39;t know where the money making happens, but he never shows his chart. So, it&#39;s hard to tell which ticker he&#39;s on. So, I am working on a different strategy. So, I&#39;m going to cut the video right here because the strategy I&#39;m working on now is going to be you just set your stop loss at the wick of this candle that creates where the fair value gap is.
(06:15)  So, I guess you would be setting up here, fair value gaps created. You would enter your stop loss right here at this candle wick and then let it run. So, let me update that real quick and then I&#39;ll be right back with you. While I was building that other strategy, I had to take my sweatshirt off.
(06:28)  I was getting so hot and bothered over this. So, this is how this one&#39;s set up to work. Now, just by the off chance, I misunderstood his strategy and how it works. Like I said, the videos change every time I see one and they get 10,000 likes and 500 comments, which is crazy to me of people being like, &quot;This is pure gold.
(06:48) &quot; The fair value gap right here being presented forms right here when this candle closes. So, it&#39;s the stop loss that I&#39;m setting now is to the wick of candle one, which is going to be right here. So, the wick of candle one is going to be the stop loss going in either direction. and it&#39;s the highest wick pretty much of this fair value gap three pattern and then it will be the lowest on the upside.
(07:13)  So, let me show you the settings really quick. I have the stop-loss method FVG candle one. I have all these different variations. So, I&#39;m going to play with this, but I&#39;m not going to do it all live here on camera. I&#39;ll just if I find a good one, I&#39;ll make another video on it. But ratio is one. I&#39;m just going to leave it there.
(07:29) If we can hit one, maybe we can hit two. And I&#39;m going to test this on NQ. I&#39;m not going to go through four or five tickers. I&#39;m just going to do it on this one. So, the last 7 days lost $2,000, 50% win rate. Last 30 days, lost $1,200, draw down of 75.45. This would be a fun experience.
(07:52)  22 total trades, 50% win rate. At least the 50% win rate&#39;s consistent. Maybe if you could figure out the profit and when to take it, you&#39;d be all right. 0 N55 profit factor. Last 90 days, you would have made $900. [ __ ] Make $10 a day if you can get through the $24,000 loss. 63 total trades. 47% profitable with a 1.013 profit factor.
(08:17)  And then the last 365, you lost $14,000. At one point, your draw down was almost $44,000 with a 49. Again, the win rate is consistent, 50%, your profit factor is not, but I don&#39;t know. Just because we&#39;re here, I&#39;m going to check ES. Let&#39;s just check it and see. This is the last 365 on ES.
(08:36)  Like I said, he never shows his chart. It&#39;s always a really cool overlay and you see how in theory it&#39;s supposed to work, but you never actually see it executed on a chart, which that&#39;s kind of a flag to me. But lost $15,000 over 365 days. 52% win rate if nothing else. It is consistent on that side. The last 90 days made 5,800 bucks.
(08:57)  If you can battle the draw down and 55% I do like the win rate. That is nice. You just have to figure out where to take your profit. It&#39;s sold though on video as a target a 2:1 reward to risk. Meaning I say one to two. I would be risking $500 to make a,000. Right now that is not even close to happening. This is great though.
(09:19)  I do like the win rate but you&#39;re not getting a one to two on this. Um the last 30 days made five grand. Draw down is manageable. I think this would be manageable. 68% win rate. That&#39;s awesome. And a profit factor of 1.7. This is cool. This is great. I Well, great&#39;s a stretch, but it&#39;s cool. And then last 7 days, you made 1,700 bucks and you&#39;re managing this draw down on any 50,000 prop firm for the most part.
(09:47)  I think Apex at $2,000, you&#39;d probably be a little not fun, but 67% win rate, but it&#39;s sold as a one to two. It get a one to2 risk-to-reward. And I just, dude, that&#39;s not a thing on this strategy. There&#39;s no way. 1,100 bucks. 30 days, 6,300 for a 68% win rate. That&#39;s great. But we already knew the 30-day looked good.
(10:07)  The last 90 days, 74.95, $10,000 draw down, 55% win rate. Last 365 days, you lost $17,000. For the sake of transparency, let&#39;s just do NQ. If you guys are even still watching, I would have gave up after the first time I did the back test. But lost 11,720 over the year. Last 90 days made $2,000. Cool. Whatever.
(10:35)  $4,300 in the last 30 days for a $7,500 draw down. 50% win rate in the last seven days. You lost 4,300 bucks. I don&#39;t see it, but the internet eats it up. So, it doesn&#39;t work though. Unless I am very clearly misunderstanding how it works, but hard to keep track of the
