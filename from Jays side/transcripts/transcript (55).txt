Transcript:
(00:00) OpenClaw/Cladbot is now helping me run my business. But if you don&#39;t know how to use it the right way, it is completely overhyped. So, I&#39;m going to show you a couple use cases in this video on how I&#39;m using it right now for real revenue use cases and how you can do the same thing, too. I literally spent probably 10 hours this week in getting everything going.
(00:17)  I got a new Mac Mini for I&#39;m going to explain why I got a Mac Mini for it. I&#39;m going to explain the different security concerns. I&#39;m going to explain the different hacks you should be doing to save on tokens, how you can speed things up a lot faster, how you can tie in with your business, and how you can just make it much more useful for you.
(00:32)  And then I&#39;m going to tell you my theory on how business is going to go, and how you might potentially have a bunch of these. You might have an army of these. So, by the end of this video, you&#39;re going to see my entire philosophy, and you&#39;re going to understand how to run this from a business and marketing and money-making standpoint.
(00:46)  If all those things are interesting to you, then this is going to be interesting to you. And if you&#39;re tired of the AI hype, then this is also a video for you. So, let&#39;s get into it. The key thing is that you need to make sure that you have guardrails with this. I&#39;m going to show you my setup just so you can start to get some ideas.
(00:58) Initially, I was a little, you know, skeptical, but now all the people that are making videos saying this is overhyped. It is only overhyped if you don&#39;t know how to use it. It&#39;s just like having a weapon. If you don&#39;t know how to use the weapon, what&#39;s the point of even having it, right? Cuz you don&#39;t know how to wield these superpowers.
(01:10)  I&#39;m going to show you how to wield these superpowers. Okay, so I have Telegram open over here. Telegram is my app of choice. And so when you&#39;re setting up OpenClaw, you have to make sure that you&#39;re hooking it in with WhatsApp, iMessage. I&#39;m picking Telegram cuz they are big on they&#39;re big on privacy.
(01:24)  The other thing too is they have these interesting topics that you can add, right? So, what I mean by that is you can have a chat where you can run multiple instances of it and that&#39;s actually one of the first ideas I&#39;m going to give you here. So, I made a little chat here called AI squad. And so, within AI squad, I have general assistance, I have personal, I have these different sections over here.
(01:40)  For example, I have one here on on SEO. So, you you can see right now, I&#39;m not lying to you. It is literally working within our product. Okay? So, it&#39;s it&#39;s logged into our our product. It&#39;s initiated article for keyword over here. It&#39;s analyzing competitors and then it&#39;s basically helping us because our focus with clickflow is on creating production grade content for growth purposes more on the SEO side and we call it search everywhere optimization and we just want to make sure that you know the quality
(02:03) is really good right so 43 articles are now in review many are agile related okay um you know five pages need attention okay great so the key thing here is it&#39;s it&#39;s working and then I actually asked hit I said hey I don&#39;t want you to produce content that&#39;s cannibalizing content on our website oh he&#39;s like okay good point here the good news I&#39;m showing you a couple examples is that the reason why you want to be using open claw, you&#39;re like, well, why is this different than, you know, using
(02:22) cloud code or anything like that? Cloud code is amazing. You should check out my videos on that. But this has contextual memory and this is something that&#39;s proactive. So, you want to think of it this way. When you think about a person that works on your team or works with you, there are people that literally level zero, they don&#39;t point out any problems.
(02:38)  They kind of just don&#39;t do anything. There&#39;s no solutions, you know, they don&#39;t they don&#39;t even point out the problems, right? Then you got level one, you got people that point out the problems. They just complain all the time. They don&#39;t do much, right? Then you have people that they will spot the problem.
(02:48)  They&#39;ll offer a solution, but they won&#39;t do the solution for you. Now the difference is by using Open Clawcloudbot in your hands, it&#39;s going to proactively spot problems, it&#39;s going to offer solutions and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going to continue to solve for you depending on how much permissions you give it, depending on how much how much leeway you give it, right? And more on that in a little bit because you want to make sure you&#39;re very careful with this because there there are security concerns with this initially. So my
(03:09) point of this is that this is doing real work over here and it&#39;s actually helping me improve on the product. And the thing is the more that I work with it, it has contextual memory. So, it&#39;s it&#39;s going to it has long-term memory, has short-term memory as well. It&#39;s going to remember how I work and then it&#39;s going to continue to get better over time.
(03:23) Okay? And that&#39;s extremely valuable. Now, if I go over to personal, I actually asked it to make a app over here. And look, let me just show you what I did. I literally took a tweet, this p this person&#39;s tweet over here, and he just talked about making a health app.
(03:37)  And I&#39;m like, you know what? I spend 400 bucks a month on this this health thing internally. Like, I want something built for me where I don&#39;t have to pay that money anymore. Okay? And so, okay, now it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s on it. It&#39;s building the foundation now, right? You know, body composition. Here&#39;s here&#39;s the foundation built.
(03:50)  Um, you have a health.md, you know, it&#39;s going to I&#39;m going to feed my daily food and workout logs in it. There&#39;s going to be percentile tracking. I want to gify to see how I&#39;m beating myself over time and how tracking gets general population and how it works now, right? So, literally I I will tell you like I I do this this thing right now.
(04:04)  I&#39;m going to cancel pretty soon, but you know, I can I can sync this in with um you know, my aura, which is my sleep tracking, my function, health numbers, my blood work, uh my V2 max, all these different things, right? That&#39;s phenomenal. One more thing I&#39;ll actually show you is I think from a product angle, maybe not a product angle, maybe general assistance over here.
(04:22)  So, okay, what I did was I wanted to figure out and this is something that you should consider too is thinking about okay and and you maybe you can take a screenshot of this but you need to make sure that when you&#39;re setting this up that you are making it aware of token awareness, right? So, what I mean is, you know, if a task is going to cost greater than 50 cents, um then it should be asking, hey, this is going to cost, you know, more than 50 cents to do this and because things get expensive.
(04:43)  I I was the 10 hours that I spent on this these last two days. I guess probably 200 bucks or so. 150 to 200 bucks or so. So, you want to keep in mind too, you&#39;re not using Opus the whole the whole time, which is as of this recording is the best anthropic model. Maybe you&#39;re using Sonnet or maybe you&#39;re using uh Kimmy, which is the the Chinese open source model that came out recently that that that&#39;s very good.
(05:00)  I chose to go with Sonnet just because I&#39;m already paying anthropic and it&#39;s I&#39;m not going to save that much more. Uh the difference between what I had before was I was spending maybe estimated $1,000 to $1,500 a month if I was going to continue to use it this way. now with a sonnet setup is maybe you know it&#39;s it&#39;s $66 a month or something like that and so if I move to Kimmy I might save $60 so it becomes $6 a month so it becomes way cheaper all this stuff is going to become cheaper anyway and I do trust um
(05:23) Enthropic with my data more al because I&#39;m I&#39;m paying them as well versus an open source um Chinese model right now right if I was running it locally I think that&#39;d be a different story so keep that in mind and that&#39;s something you need to decide right and so I&#39;m going to come back to some of my my my decisions with the setup too in a little bit but you can see here okay response templates uh leading with outcomes not process and so I want this thing to not just, you know, give me a bunch of word
(05:44) soup. I just wanted to talk about how we how we do things and and talk about the potential outcomes. You know, batching rule, don&#39;t make API calls when one will do. Okay, that&#39;s a really good one. Code safety, get commit before changes, run tests uh after, never push domain without approval, anti-attern list, especially don&#39;t ask clarifying question when context is obvious, right? And so all these things I will say that maybe you&#39;re watching this right now, you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh my god, I&#39;m not technical. I
(06:05) don&#39;t know how to set this up.&quot; There are so many videos out there on setting up cloud code and also setting up you know openclaw/cloudbot and I think the most important thing is that you sit in the pain and you understand this stuff cuz I don&#39;t know how to code but I do understand systems thinking well and I do understand my business well and I do understand marketing well and so these are all things that if you have these in your head everything&#39;s a mindset game you&#39;re going to be good. Okay, so these are
(06:26) just a couple examples. And then um the reason I have it set up like this in these different topics is cuz I can continue to chat with it in in different ones, right? And so around product over here is, you know, maybe I might say, you know, I I want you to help me build another feature for Carrot, which which is our LinkedIn account based marketing software or I want you to um I want you to scan kind of what&#39;s happening with uh with Carrot, right? And um you know, help me figure out, you know, imbue yourself with the wisdom of the 10 best
(06:50) product people in the world and um you know, rate the product. and I want you to give me ideas that are 95 out of 100. So, you know, that&#39;s like a solid A, right? All that to say is the decisions I made here was so when you&#39;re setting this up, yes, initially you&#39;re going to have to log into the CLI, so the the command line interface.
(07:05)  You&#39;re going to have to log into your, you know, the terminal. You&#39;re going to have to type in a couple commands. There&#39;s going to be some some setup required where the things that I want it to do, I&#39;m able to call on this as it relates to my goal. So, whatever you&#39;re comfortable sharing should go in here. All right.
(07:18)  So, this is me talking to my my bot over here, Alfred. Okay. So, Alfred from Batman. Okay. He even has a little butler hat over here. So, um, Alfred, what I was working with it on it originally was, hey, I want you to again level up the content that we&#39;re putting out for for Clickflow, right? And then you can see for ClickFlow, it&#39;s a brand new product.
(07:35) And so, for for this year, you know, it&#39;d be nice if we can hit 1.6 million ARR for this new product. Um, probably maybe even more if we can really push the pace on it. But if the content quality is is just levels above, head and shoulders above other people&#39;s, I think it can grow even faster than that.
(07:48) And then we want to go kind of probably beyond SEO, too. So, prove Clickflow can publish publishable can produce publishable content within 30 minutes of editing, track conversion impact, right? And so, it has it&#39;s it&#39;s tracking all these things over here. Document time to publish and quality metrics.
(08:02)  Now, you might be wondering from a business standpoint, from a marketing standpoint, okay, you have a lot of goals. You&#39;re working with the team. Um, or let&#39;s say you&#39;re just you&#39;re working on a company right now and you report directly to CEO. So, you want these things to be on top of what your metrics are.
(08:14)  And so for us, we have our our three-year targets, our, you know, our budget for this year, accountability chart, who owns what exactly, the weekly KPI trends, so to keep the metronome going. And this will tell you if things are off and it can kind of scan around and this I have a lot that&#39;s plugged into this locally.
(08:28) Um, you know, my my granola notes, so the notes that I that that take in that happen in my the the meetings that I&#39;m in, right? So that&#39;s in there. The gong transcripts, the sales transcripts that we have, the talking to prospects, talking to customers constantly, um, synced in with HubSpot, too.
(08:41)  It is synced in with Google Analytics, Google Search Console, right? All these things. Now, key thing that I&#39;ll call out over here from a security standpoint is that again, I have this running on a local device and I have a one password vault shared only one vault that that&#39;s shared with specific information on access to the these different tools I have.
(08:57)  So, I&#39;m not going to give it access to, you know, all the passwords that I have. I&#39;m not going to give it access to my emails. I&#39;m not going to have the login here because prompt injection is a it&#39;s a real risk, right? And so, I don&#39;t want that to happen. So, am I going to say my security is a 10 out of 10? No.
(09:10)  But I also understand that there are no solutions, only trade-offs, right? There&#39;s always trade-offs to these things and so I can get things to the best my ability to secure as possible. And I just want to keep that in mind. So I have uh Apple ID for this. I have my own Gmail for this one as well. It has access to its own Gmail, too.
(09:24)  And um you know, again, it&#39;s it&#39;s set up right next to me, this little Mac Mini. I will say one more thing, too. You don&#39;t need to necessarily buy a new monitor. If you have an iPad, for example, literally all I did, and maybe I&#39;ll just show you right now, is um you can see over here, here&#39;s the iPad, right? And this little USBC uh cord over here is hooked in with my Mac Mini.
(09:42)  Okay? And so I I downloaded an app called Yam Display. And literally all I did once you set up your your you have to set it up on a normal computer first and then get the Yam Display app for your Mac and then get it for your iPad. And then after that, it&#39;s pretty seamless. You just kind of plug it in and then the the keyboard works over here, the mouse works over here.
(09:59)  It&#39;s great. I didn&#39;t expect it to. So originally like I was I was using my studio display to set it up and then I kind of just plugged it in. And that happened actually, you know, a couple hours ago or something. Now it knows your goals. It knows your context. It&#39;s going to get better with you. What I will say is, okay, what are the daily cron jobs that are happening? Okay, so you know, 7:30 a.m.
(10:15)  daily strategic digest, okay? Calendar urgent items, high max high leverage ideas. So I&#39;m looking for high leverage ideas and it&#39;s connected to all the connections I have from a deal manufacturer standpoint, right? And what that means is it&#39;s going to look at, oh, it knows, you know, we&#39;re trying to grow grow a carrot faster, single grain faster, click flow faster.
(10:34)  Okay, the deal of the day that&#39;s interesting to you, you should talk to this person over here. And I looked at a couple of the the outputs and like I was like, that&#39;s pretty good. like one of the persons people that recommended we connect with we have connected with recently we actually made the hire recently too um and so it was it was spot on.
(10:47)  I&#39;ll tell you you might thinking that you might be thinking that this is not that useful. I will tell you using this type of um workflow I was able to book a meeting a couple like actually what two meetings with um truly me plus companies um and that that they are now leading to other things. I&#39;ll just leave it at that right and so if sales is your thing or marketing is your thing this is something to consider.
(11:05) Select look at this deal of the day. One S tier contact opportunity with outreach template ready to send. So it noted when I when I connected with this person what the angle was and it also gave the outreach as well. And the outreach was pretty damn good. Okay. Now we&#39;ll continue over here.
(11:19)  X/ Twitter radar three to five relationship opportunities to engage with. Right. Car target research five B2B target companies with decision makers and angles. Uh ClickFlow competitive intel. Uh so Clickflow competes with um you know Surfer Aerobs Clear Scope and we I we we know all these people and they&#39;re they&#39;re all great.
(11:34)  Um but you know there&#39;s the the proliferation of software now right means that um taking a look at what people are building and then deciding what we want to do um internally. Um and then YouTube four on four ideas. So this was taken from u one of the YouTube frameworks that we learned in terms of you know five to 10 content ideas um from the top creators in my niche and we want four examples four proven examples and then like similar types of examples that have worked in the last four months or so right and these are you know silent things that are happening you
(11:59) know um behind the scenes. All that to say is that this is your internal command center that is very proactive with you. And I am also being restrictive in terms of what I&#39;m letting it do right now. So you can let it yolo. You can let it do whatever it wants. And you see people on X talk. Oh my god, it built its own, you know, voice agent.
(12:16) Oh, it started drawing a picture of itself. Um, you know, started talking to me through voice. It can do all those things. Okay. The only thing is I don&#39;t want it to just kind of freely just go around the internet and and doing whatever it wants right now. I want it to I want it to prove itself to me.
(12:29)  Just think of it as you&#39;re hiring an employee, you&#39;re working with someone new, trust must be earned, right? And you know, until I feel like I can trust it completely. And by the way, like it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s not like it&#39;s it&#39;s sentient, right? It&#39;s kind of just logging on every day and running the same uh it&#39;s running jobs and building on on on context, right? So, you got to set it up correctly there.
(12:46)  Real quick, if you want to acquire customers faster and more efficiently this year with the latest strategies and tactics, then check out singlein.com. That is my ad agency. Again, www.singlegrain.com. check it out and if it seems like a fit, we&#39;ll get in touch and help you with a free marketing plan.
(13:03)  Okay, so a couple things when it comes to setup, you want to make sure that you are not spending as much on from a token standpoint because again it can get very expensive very quickly. So this is from Benjamin Decracker and he&#39;s like made some adjustments based on lessons learned combined roughly 200 to 400 times cheaper heartbeat operation.
(13:19)  And so heartbeat is just like you&#39;re you&#39;re you can have it running these jobs in the background every 30 minutes or so, every hour or so, whatever it is exactly. So um you can see here originally he was using Opus which is the most expensive model right now and then now he&#39;s using Kimmy which is much cheaper right interval for the heartbeat was every 30 minutes now it&#39;s 1 1 hour and then um 24/7 it&#39;s on right this one it&#39;s it&#39;s 14 hours a day and then the the cash but 5 minutes over to 60 minutes so 200 to 400
(13:43) times cheaper 12 times less fewer rewrites um an hour savings uh model savings and all these things and so I ran this and basically look I just took a screenshot of this and I dumped it into Telegram and so I installed Telegram onto I have it on I have it on my iPad. I have it on my desktop as well.
(13:59)  So, I can control this thing from wherever in the world. And so, it&#39;s running locally on my computer. Okay. So, this this type of thing is going to save you a ton of money. All right. And the next thing is I use this to um from Alex Prompter to level up, you know, some of the things over here. So, always estimate token cost, which is what you saw earlier for task, you know, greater than 50 uh 50 cents.
(14:17)  Ask permission first, batch some operations, uh security boundaries, communication style, core capabilities. So, these are all rules that you want to set in place because it&#39;s it&#39;s going to continue to refer to these rules over time. You&#39;re better off getting this right initially so you don&#39;t end up getting burnt.
(14:30)  And this is again why people are like, &quot;Oh, you know, it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s overhyped. The security risk is too much.&quot; Well, like when are you actually going to do something? Anyway, that&#39;s for another video. Okay. So, then we come over here and this is from Bill, but this is a multiple Telegram threads with your open clause and bit unlock.
(14:45)  And so, when I use cloud code, for example, I have multiple tabs open, right? And you have it running and running different things. And so, I did this today. Okay. So, set up a Telegram group, enable topics which allow you to create these different groups which you saw earlier. I had a product one, an SEO one, a social media one.
(14:57)  It&#39;s just like, oh, Bill and Jarvis, right? So, I&#39;m just working with it within each one. I&#39;m just tagging it saying, &quot;Hey, like I need your help on the SEO stuff over here. I need your help on the social stuff.&quot; All that to say is is this is just the very beginning, but I&#39;m having it work in parallel processes right now.
(15:09)  And you&#39;re able to just get a lot more done that way, right? I would actually prefer to probably work on a desktop, the desktop version of Telegram, cuz working on your phone, it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s tough, right? or even my iPad with the keyboard like I think you&#39;re going to be more effective that way.
(15:22)  Now the other thing here is um just what I mentioned earlier it&#39;s very token hungry and and you want to be more cost- effective with it. So open router actually allows you it routes simple tasks like heartbeats and status checks to cheaper models. So you can actually make this go from what I was mentioning earlier.
(15:34)  So you can Kimmy will make it cheaper but if you use this it&#39;ll actually bring your cost down from like $60 a month to like I don&#39;t know $6 a month or something like that. So this is part of it and I would just recommend that you&#39;re you&#39;re looking at everything across the board and sometimes I&#39;ll just ask I&#39;ll take a screenshot and say hey like we&#39;ve built a lot of things already like how necessary is this right now because again I&#39;m not a technical person so claude or enthropic whatever model you&#39;re using codeex right they will
(15:53) teach you or it will teach you what you need to know and understand kind of the trade-offs and and that&#39;s very important you should be always asking what are the trade-offs here and not just kind of blindly accept everything which entrepreneurs like myself have a have a propensity to kind of accept everything.
(16:06) The next one I want to call out is from um the founder of Shopify, Toby. So he has a thing called QMD over here, which basically makes it a lot faster to search your entire database. Let&#39;s just put it that way, right? So your meeting notes, whatever knowledge base. And so if I have my granola notes, if I have HubSpot data, I have, you know, all by the way, it&#39;s ingested all of my podcasts from all the years, my YouTube stuff.
(16:30)  Um and it&#39;s going to every week it&#39;s doing the crown job updating on the most recent content. And then imagine this, if you have a second brain of myself, it can go around actually coaching people too. And then it can learn to make decisions like myself as well. And so this is getting scary good, but there&#39;s a lot of these upgrades that you should consider adding.
(16:45)  Um, that&#39;s why I&#39;m showing you this stuff right now. Even um there&#39;s certain like could because it pulls from my GitHub, it&#39;s also important for you to kind of look at, you know, different skills you can add too. So Corey Haynes has these really good um these these marketing skills.
(16:58)  And so if you just search like by the way Toby Toby T O BI QMD um get you should be able to find this. Um and then if you search for Corey Haynes 31 marketing skills you can pause this video at this section if you want. Um but you know you can even look at the different skills that he has. So look you can do AB test you can do form CRO onboarding CRO page CRO all these things and you can upgrade these skills if you want which is what we&#39;re doing internally at at my ad agency Single Rain.
(17:23)  we&#39;re updating these skills because the the future that I&#39;m seeing and this will kind of um this will hopefully make you excited is um you know you&#39;re going to have these AI assistants helping you or these uh open claws, let&#39;s just call them claws or you&#39;re going to have many Alfreds, let&#39;s call that, right? You&#39;re going have many butlers helping you um do these tasks that to be frank you shouldn&#39;t be doing nor should your team be doing.
(17:44)  And um you know what we&#39;re going to be doing is at least I&#39;m kind of declaring it right now is is you know my team&#39;s going to you know they&#39;re going to have these Alfreds assisting them. And the way I see this is that Cloudflare actually came out with these programmatic SEO. So this is one of the skills, right? You can see initial assessment, okay, unique value per page, proprietary data wins.
(18:00) This actually starts to ask you questions on, hey, what is your website? What are you trying to do exactly? What are the goals exactly? And then this is um these are the the playbooks. These are the templates that work for programmatic SEO. And so again, you can you can take this and and build on it, right? This is the the the checklist over here.
(18:15)  But things are going to become a lot more predictable. and then you have a human in the loop to finish off the last you know 10 15 20% or so the the last mile that is how you want to think about work you don&#39;t want to think about work in terms of just tasks in the future or you you want to think about work as evolving tasks and more importantly you want to be thinking about the purpose of the work that you&#39;re doing also the purpose of the work that people on your team are doing too because because that&#39;s changing rapidly and you want to bring people
(18:36) into this new world to get them to reimagine how they think about things right because you know initially getting set up with cloud code I mean that was literally a month ago okay cloud code and then you know I saw more chatter people talking about clawbot now now called openclaw right and the chatter got got higher and higher everyone started buying these Mac minis I&#39;m like okay I I got I got to get on this right and that was I mean that that all happened within four weeks of each other okay then the world is just changing so
(19:01) quickly it feels like years are happening within weeks right now and let me tell you the most exciting thing that is interesting to me okay so Cloudflare so publicly traded company they are you know content delivery network for all intents and purposes but they do care about enterp Enterprise Security and they&#39;re a company that you can you can trust, right? Because a lot of people have tried to hack, you know, Cloudflare in the past.
(19:22)  So, Molt Worker is a middleware worker. So, by the way, Claude, okay, it was called Claudebot and then they changed it to Molbot and then now it&#39;s called Open Claw. So, it&#39;s changed a couple times. Okay, this is designed specifically for OpenClaw. So, mo worker is a middleware worker and adapted scripts that allows running mult sandbox SDK uh software development kit and our developer platform API.
(19:42)  So, you can self-host an AI personal assistant without any new hardware. So, what how I&#39;m thinking about this right now is I&#39;m I&#39;m going to have a local version that&#39;s just focused on on on me. That&#39;s my chief of staff. And I might have more local versions. That&#39;s fine. But for my team, because they don&#39;t need to have that much, they don&#39;t need to go that deep.
(19:59)  I don&#39;t need to give them all that data. I could have a one of these workers just for the SEO team, one just for the paid media team, one just for the sales team, one for the ops team. Okay? And then by the way, it might train off of my it will continue to train off of my uh my base knowledge and kind of what I&#39;m seeing um and then give feedback on things.
(20:16)  And I might not be right all the time. In fact, I&#39;m wrong many times, right? But this allows me to be in multiple places. And this also lets me see kind of decisions that we&#39;re making across the board on on different teams. And so, you know, in my mind, I I think this is going to help, you know, there&#39;s going to be these um kind of squad leaders um these squad AI Alfreds for different teams.
(20:35)  And then I think they&#39;re going to be managing um you know Alfreds below them, right? So we&#39;re talking about agent on agent on agent and this is this is real autonomous work and um that&#39;s how I see it right now. Right? So again you&#39;re going to have a local setup like the you know Mac mini um and the reason why I chose the Mac mini and not the VPS is because VPS like with with you know people talk about open cloud like there are huge security vulnerability vulnerabilities right now that people aren&#39;t paying attention to.
(20:58) So imagine if if all your personal data is being leaked out there um or you know sensitive you know whatever other other stuff that you have um that is not a good thing right and so you want to do whatever you can and and work with your u your open claw instance and your your assistant just ask hey what else can we do to bolster security and just understand that there will be trade-offs right that&#39;s what I would say okay so I want to tie this all together now so I just mentioned you know why it&#39;s useful
(21:22) this the specific uses gave you a couple examples too I&#39;d show you a couple things I would recommend re-watching this video because there&#39;s a lot examples scattered within here, right? But let me just I&#39;ll make it simple for a second. Then I&#39;ll go go through what&#39;s on the screen.
(21:33)  So, I would prefer setting it up locally, which is why I got a Mac Mini. Okay. Number two, you want to make sure that you are setting up for your local device its own Gmail account, its own Apple ID, and you want to make sure that it only has if it has access to things, it only has access to specific segments of it.
(21:50)  So, again, I didn&#39;t give it access to all of my my password uh manager, you know, folders, right? I only gave it access to one specific thing. and and you know you have to learn how to set that up. The other thing I&#39;ll say too is you decide how much context that you want to give it depending on your goals and you should you know work on building trust with it gradually and not try to just yellow everything.
(22:09)  The other thing I&#39;ll say too is if you&#39;re going to try to set it up on on an iPad just make sure you&#39;re setting up on a normal monitor and then on an iPad you can download Yam Display and that will allow you to that&#39;s Yam Yam Display and it will allow you to kind of just work with everything on the iPad and again I I have the keyboard and you can use the mouse on it too and it&#39;s it&#39;s great.
(22:26)  And then I would say really you want to be scouring X and just seeing what people are talking about and just bookmarking a ton of things. That that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing, right? From a security angle. What can I do to save on tokens? What can I do to make it more secure? What can I do to make it more efficient in terms of working with me? And you want to make sure that you you ask it to be proactive with you, right? And so when you&#39;re setting it up, it has actually a soulm so sou.
(22:47) md where it has its own personality. U there there are a handful of things that you want to set up. The the soul of it, you know, the the memory, the the long-term memory, the short-term memory. You want to make sure that it&#39;s it&#39;s not just waiting to be told what to do that it&#39;s it&#39;s proactive with you right and I would say again I chose to go with telegram and then you know you saw the different groups that I use kind of work with it in parallel and then we use opus but then originally I was using opus by itself and then but
(23:07) that was too expensive and so you want to have it be smart in terms of using the lower cost models in other areas especially when they&#39;re like repeating tasks where they maybe don&#39;t need to you know put all that thinking power behind it right and a lot of these you know token costs are going to are going to come down over time so uh what I have on my screen over here this is from this by Banu.
(23:26)  And so Banu, he has this mission control and you can see these are all the agents that he has. So Banu is over here and then he has you have Friday, the developer agent. You have Fury, the customer research agent. Jarvis, the squad lead. Um, so my squad lead is is Alfred. You have Pepper for email marketing. Each one of these has a personality.
(23:40)  So I highly recommend searching for his uh post on mission control. If you just search for like Banu B Hu Mission Control X, you should be able to find it. At least in Grock, you should be able to find it. There&#39;s a SEO analyst designer documentation. Okay, so look, he&#39;s got 10 agents or 11 agents here working with him.
(23:54)  And this is almost like a it&#39;s a combine board over here. Inbox, assign, in progress, review. And so he can see he can see them all working. Okay. I already was thinking about this over the weekend until I stumbled across this post. I was like, &quot;Okay, if I have one main leader and they&#39;re they&#39;re coordinating the other ones.
(24:08) &quot; This is literally the the org charts that you saw where it&#39;s like one agent managing sub agent, sub agents managing sub agents. It just goes more and more and more. This is happening right now. I I I thought we&#39;re a couple years out from that, but it&#39;s happening right now. And so again, people that say it&#39;s overrated or security issues or whatever. Yes, security issues.
(24:22) Definitely not overrated, but as long as you&#39;re careful with how you go about these things, I I just think if you don&#39;t if you don&#39;t actually use it from a for a money-making context, I just think you&#39;re being lazy. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m not even sorry, actually. Like, I just think you&#39;re being lazy.
(24:35)  And so, that&#39;s why I made this video. Like, I I&#39;m like, you can see the excitement. Like, for me to spend, you know, 10 hours of my weekend on it, I feel like it&#39;s be like with cloud code, things have become way more fun with work. I think with this, oh my god, it&#39;s like a step change even above that, right? So, I would say you just want to be careful here because I&#39;m going to I&#39;m probably going to set up two of these agents, one for SEO, one for social initially, and then I&#39;ll think about and then I&#39;ll work with
(24:56) Alfred. So, maybe I&#39;ll have like three of these to to work with initially. I I think there&#39;s a lot of things that we could be doing better u from an SEO angle just to improve click flow. But on a social angle in terms of repurposing my content and things like that, I think there&#39;s a lot more we can do.
(25:08)  And so, if I can make these u magical clippers and social media distributors, uh that&#39;s going to be great, right? So, just look at all the crazy stuff that can happen here. They&#39;re they&#39;re kind of commenting and they&#39;re interacting with each other. They&#39;re talking to each other. So, to me, I think this is very exciting.
(25:21)  And that being said, let me know what you think in the comments. And if you haven&#39;t really experienced Cloud Code yet, you want to check out this video over here on why Cloud Code will make you a boatload of money on top of Open Cloud. See you there.
