Transcript:
(00:00) As we wrap up January, I took a total payout from Apex and from Topstep of almost $17,000 in the month of January. If we really want to be exact, to the penny, I got payouts of $16,911.84. I&#39;ll show you proof of that that I posted in our Discord. And then I will show you the tools that I used and how I did this for the month of January and how I expect to do it in the month of February as well.
(00:25)  So, as you can see right here, total January payout recap. I won&#39;t read all of this to you, but Apex alone, I made $12,588.84. And then Topep $4,323. And then I put pictures of my bank deposits and my statements. You can see right here, I blacked out my balances, but on the 20th and the 22nd, I had 12,500 plus from Apex.
(00:48)  On those two days, I then had on the 4th of January two different payouts from two different Express accounts with Topstep of almost $2,000. I then two days later had another one come through of 1,14. And then just today to wrap up January, I got another payout on one of the other five express accounts I have of $1180, which brought me to my grand total of $16,911.
(01:12) 84 for the month of January. So, the big question is, how did I do it? What did I do to get almost $17,000 in payouts? Let me show you what I did, what I&#39;ve built, and how you can get access to it. And don&#39;t worry, I will be transparent with you. Not everything is behind a payw wall, but there is some stuff that is paid.
(01:33)  But I will show you Apex, where I made over $12,000 came from this indicator right here that I built, and I will show you how to get it. It&#39;s free. Go into Trading View and search orb plus key session levels QC. That&#39;s me, Quantcrawler. I built a website called Quant Crawler, and I made this indicator. And as you can see, this is for the opening range break.
(01:52)  So the opening range break works like this. I have the indicator set from 8:00 a.m. to 8:15, 15minute range to mark out this 15-minute candle right here. And then it also marks out the key resistance levels and support levels of previous sessions. So on the 23rd of January is a perfect example of exactly how this works and how you can use it to make money.
(02:14)  So, let&#39;s just focus on for the first part the opening range right here. In theory, when this breaks below and it comes back and retouches the midpoint or touches the zone, you can do it however you want, but let&#39;s just say it breaks below, it comes back and the price action retouches the midpoint.
(02:32)  In theory and true to the opening range break, at this point, you would enter a short thinking this range is going to be defended and come back down. You can see here on this day that very clearly did not happen initially, but you get another breakout here. It touches the zone. You would have entered a long because you broke out to the top side.
(02:51) Enter a long right here on the midpoint retest and you run all the way up to the Asia high. Now, you would have set your takerit somewhere probably in this range targeting whatever your risk-to-reward is. I always look for a one to two. So, I would not have been in this trade all the way up to the top.
(03:07)  But if I was, I would have set my take-profit right below this resistance level just in case because New York volume can blow right past these or as you can see here, a perfect rejection off of the Asia high resistance. This level was defended. So, recapping with you, this one right here, if you would have went short, that would have been a loss.
(03:26)  But being true to the opening range break strategy, that&#39;s what the call would have been. But you then immediately get a breakout the top and a retest. You go long all the way up here. Now you could have entered a short because it bounces off the resistance level and comes back. There would have been another win.
(03:44)  Then it comes all the way back down, retouches the zone. You could have went long again, but most likely you wouldn&#39;t have had your stop loss all the way down here. You probably would have lost that. But then you see it hits the Asia low support and immediately pulls back the other way. So these resistance levels, these key session levels are incredibly important because they provide battle zones.
(04:06)  You get all this price action, battle zone, comes all the way back down through the range, battle zone, low support, and then it comes back up to the London high. Look at that. Hits the London high even though it&#39;s already been cleared. But this indicator right here would have told you this is the London high.
(04:22)  There is a chance it could still be defended. It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense because it was already cleared right here. But it very easily was defended. It hit and came right back down. And where did it land? Right at the Asia low. These key session levels, look how important and critical they are on this day.
(04:39)  This is everything you need to know on how you could have played this day. And this does happen multiple times a week. It doesn&#39;t happen every day, but it happens I&#39;m going to say at least two times a week. And that doesn&#39;t sound like a lot, but when I trade, I risk $500 to make a,000.
(04:57)  So, if we do the math and we start at the very beginning right here, hits London low, New York kicks in right here at 9:30, touches London low again, you could have went long, it&#39;s going to is it break support or stay? Then it runs up, target a 1 to2. That would have been $1,000 win. I wouldn&#39;t have went below support level.
(05:14)  I would have ran this up to $1,000. Then I would have probably played the orb right here and would have went short. I would have lost 500. I&#39;d still be net 500 on the day. I get a break. I would then enter in right here. I make my $1,000 on the way up. So now I&#39;m net $1,500 right here. I go short thinking this resistance level is going to be defended.
(05:35)  I make another $1,000 on my way down. $2,500. Runs all the way through to Asia low support. I run it again. 3500 4500. And it lands back down here. You can see there&#39;s ridiculous money-making opportunities just on this one chart right here. And this indicator is free. I made it. You can just go on and download it.
(05:56)  The only thing I ask, boost it. Click this little button right here. When you get to it, it helps push it up the charts so other people get to use this opportunity as well. That&#39;s all I ask. It&#39;s free though. Click this button. The other thing I use right here is QuantCrawler. This is the website that I built.
(06:10)  I am the CEO and owner of quantcrawler.com. This platform takes charts, a 15-minute, a 5 minute, and a one minute, and it analyzes it, and it gives you the support and resistance levels, the trends, the patterns, every single thing that it can identify from those screenshots and gives you a projected move of what the market is going to do.
(06:29) You get a free 30-day trial and then after that, it&#39;s $9.99 a month. It&#39;s less than $10 a month. You log into Quant Crawler, and this is what you see right here, futures. You click this and it brings you into the analyzer. This is what you do. You then come back over to Trading View.
(06:46)  Let me clear this and I&#39;ll show you exactly. Let&#39;s go to gold. I trade Asia session gold specifically with Quant Crawler. It gives me the best results. So, you want to go to your 15minute chart. You want to make all this fit so you get as much data as you can. And you hit control shift and S and it takes a screenshot.
(07:05)  You then come back into Quant Crawler and you paste it. That&#39;s your 15minute. You do the same thing on the 5m minute. Control shift and S. Paste it in. And then lastly, the 1 minute. Control shift and S. You paste it in and you click analyze and let it go to work. Now, when it is done, it gives you an output.
(07:22)  Here&#39;s your disclaimer. May make calculation errors. It&#39;s I legally have to have that on there, but you can see trade setup. The ticker is GC. Current price 5400. Entry. It says wait for a small $5 pullback. I don&#39;t like this right here. I don&#39;t wait for pullbacks and I built this.
(07:39)  The only reason a limit order is in here is because the community requested it. We have over 4,000 people in our Discord and people like the limit orders. I hate it. I would remove it if I could. People like it so I leave it. Says wait for a small pullback $5. The confidence is 90% long and recommendation. All time frames confirm strong bullish momentum and a clear uptrend indicating a high probability of continued price appreciation.
(08:03)  There are three different options you can do if you want to do a single contract, multiple contracts, or if you just want to do what the chart structure says. This option one and two is for people who use a risk-to-reward system. Then right here tells you 15 minutes price is in a clear sustained bullish uptrend forming higher highs and higher lows with strong momentum.
(08:22)  Price has broken above a recent consolidation range and is pushing towards new highs with the 5375 area acting as immediate support and 5405 as immediate resistance which is currently being breached. Then right down here and lastly at the bottom AI reasoning gold futures are exhibiting robust bullish sentiment across all time frames.
(08:41)  The 15-minute chart displays a strong established uptrend while the 5minute shows a clear breakout above recent resistance. So I&#39;m not going to read the rest of it but this is what I do. opening range break with key session battle zones off the support and resistance levels. And then I use Quant Crawler to analyze Asia gold.
(08:58)  I don&#39;t use Quant Crawler that often during New York. I don&#39;t use it during London. Quant crawler knows how to break down gold sessions in Asia. The other piece to my strategy is the bulletproof indicator that I have built. So the bulletproof indicator is exclusive to our lifetime members at Quant Crawler. This is not included with the $9.
(09:19) 99 a month membership, but I&#39;m showing you this right here because you can very clearly see how this performs right here. Based on nine different confluences, this green signal when this candle closed on the 5minute chart fired an entry. That&#39;s what the green means. Right here is your cue to enter.
(09:37)  So when you enter in right here, you set your stop loss where it says to set it and then let it run all the way up to where it fires the exit right here. So in total when this actually closed, you would have been at a 1 to3 risk-to-reward right in here, this range somewhere. So whatever your number is, this indicator would have called whatever you&#39;re risking and whatever contract you&#39;re on.
(10:01)  I&#39;m just giving you a quick example of how it works. At its peak, if you were really running it up, you would have had a one to four. So, you can see here, this indicator called the entry right here. It never even came close to touching the stop-loss and ran all the way up here. So, at worst case, you&#39;re at a 1 to three.
(10:20)  So, right there, great signal. Solid win. Now, take a look at this one. You think that one was a solid win? Look right here. You would get your fire right here, and you would enter in at this point. Now, let&#39;s be transparent because I always am. If you set your stop loss right here where it says to, you would have been ticked out.
(10:38) I don&#39;t set my stop loss like this. I automate this. So, when it enters, it runs until these X&#39;s fire for me no matter what. I don&#39;t have a stop loss. I let it go. So, if I would have entered in right here, the stop loss really is not relevant to me because I would not have been ticked out unless Ghost had a quick turn like this one here.
(11:01)  See, you would have entered in right here, it went low, a couple candles later, it fires the X&#39;s. This one, I would have ended in a loss, but I would have just been coming off of this monster of a win. Look at this one right here where it fired the ex&#39;s for me. Let&#39;s even go to the bottom of that candle.
(11:18)  it would have fired at the bottom of this right here. This is a one to 111. And when I go in, I&#39;m typically risking $500 every single time. That&#39;s what I&#39;m willing to give up if I were to run a stop-loss. In this scenario, I&#39;m just in at the contract price. But this right here was a 1 to11.
(11:34)  This would have been a multiple,000 win for me that was automated that goes into my numbers. But you can see again, transparent right here. This is a loss. Detracts from this. Then right here, we&#39;re in another one. And this is today, the 28th of January. So you have another one right here. Set your stop loss. Doesn&#39;t even come close and it&#39;s running like you&#39;re in it.
(11:56)  This is already at a 1 to2 and it&#39;s going to keep going. So between the opening range break with key levels, Quant Crawler and Asia Gold and the bulletproof indicator, I&#39;m bringing in $17,000 a month. the lifetime membership with quantcrawler.com if you&#39;re curious. Onetime payment $349 until Saturday the 31st of January.
(12:17) After that, it&#39;s $5.99 until March 1st. And after March 1st, lifetime memberships are no longer for sale. And the bulletproof indicator is not sold separately anywhere else. Lifetime exclusive.
