Transcript:
(00:00) Most people are using AI to answer very simple questions on tools like Chat GBT. Meanwhile, I&#39;m using AI agents running on this Mac Mini to run my entire content operation with over 2.5 million followers across 15 different accounts. So, I have an OpenClaw AI agent that runs on this Mac Mini and it drafts all my tweets.
(00:22)  It manages all of my projects. It has full control over my notion. It has full control over linear. It can extract my competitor&#39;s videos and it can even generate thumbnails and many more. I can get it to create skills just by chatting with the AI agent. And these skills are what allows it to go off and do different things.
(00:44)  And so in this video, I want to talk about the seven most useful skills that I&#39;ve given my AI agent after spending a full week building out this AI agent. And by the end of this video, you are going to understand seven really useful skills, what they do, and how they&#39;re useful, and how to set them up.
(01:04)  Let&#39;s not waste any more time. Let&#39;s dive in to building useful AI agents for business. Okay, so OpenClaw is just an AI agent that you can download on OpenClaw.ai. And if you scroll down and run this command in your terminal, you can get OpenClaw on your computer. Some people are running OpenClaw on a Mac Mini or one of their old computers.
(01:27)  That&#39;s great. You can do that. This video is going to assume that you already have Claudebot downloaded. I&#39;m going to link down below tons of videos on how to get started. Many people have made that video. I want to make sure that I&#39;m providing valuable content. And so, this content is going to be about how to configure your Cladbot to be extremely useful like uh how to organize your skills when creating skills.
(01:51)  How do you verify if your skills are actually good? How do you get actual outputs? And then how do you use external services like Tfully, Notion, Linear, uh, Nano, Banana, and other AI models? How do you use those in your skills? So, that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to be covering in today&#39;s video.
(02:10)  So, after you get set up on OpenClaw.ai, you&#39;re going to want to connect it to one of the messaging apps. You can use iMessage, WhatsApp, and Telegram. I&#39;m telling you right now, Telegram has everything that you need. First of all, it&#39;s the easiest setup. WhatsApp is a nightmare. Cladbot in Telegram also has access to all of the commands.
(02:29)  So, I can reset the chat by typing slashreset. I can type slashkill and my clawbot. Again, this is running on my Mac Mini right here. But I communicate with it through Telegram. It&#39;s about to respond with all the skills. So here I can see all of the skills that this agent has access to. And Telegram is just incredibly easy to use. I removed all of the chats.
(02:55)  I basically minimized all of the settings. And now I have only my agents in Telegram. So I use it as a dedicated app. I like iMessage, but I don&#39;t want to mix my agents with the people that I talk to all the time on iMessage. It would be way too cluttered. I think the next best option is Slack, but I&#39;m huge proponent of Telegram.
(03:18)  So, I recommend connecting it and using it as your dedicated app. And that&#39;s my take. Okay. So, after you&#39;ve set it up to a messaging app, the next thing is you want to view and understand the files. All Cloudbot is is an app with an agent running. And as you use the agent, the agent is going to be updating little files within an app or a folder or a directory.
(03:42)  And so what I want you to do is just go to your agent and say, &quot;Where is the folder that contains all of the files located? Give me a file path location.&quot; Right? This is one of the first things that you should do because if you&#39;re untenical like me, you&#39;re not going to know where this is being stored, right? You can see that here it&#39;s in your whatever you named it uhopenclaw/workspace.
(04:06) So it&#39;s in users whatever your name is. And so you can find the exact path. And so what you can do is is you can go to finder. Go to finder. And what I want you to do is you can actually just go find that location. You can see you can just go here dotclaw. In order to expose the ones that start with a period, you have to hit commandshift dot.
(04:30)  Now you can see that we have this uh all of the openclaw. So now you can view into this. And so here are all of the files that are in your open claw that you just set up. Many of you follow me for my vibe coding tutorials on cursor or other tools like it. And I still think this is the best place to view it. You can also use VS Code.
(04:51)  It&#39;s the easiest way to view all the files. You just hit open projects. You go to that same location and we&#39;re going to hit openclaw. And we&#39;re just going to open this whole project. So now we can see everything that is within your project and I think this is incredibly important and the most important folder in this project is this workspace folder and then in this folder what you have is you have like the core identity of your agent.
(05:20)  So you have this agents.m MD file. You have this identity.md file and it talks about things like its core behaviors. It has obsessions, right? I&#39;ve when I set up this Claudebot initially, I basically told it what it&#39;s obsessed about based on what I&#39;m obsessed about. Since this is my content agent, I want it to have interests.
(05:43)  And so you can you can give it interests. You know, whether or not it&#39;s actually interested in those things is is up for debate, but it acts as if it has obsessions over content and marketing. It&#39;s obsessed over details, hooks, intros, turning viewers into conversions, building strong brand and turning them into sustainable businesses, growth hacking, all of the things you would want an employee who&#39;s in charge of content obsessed with.
(06:08)  You can make it its obsession. It has a memory uh file. I have a mission.md file that is referenced in its soul file. So the soul file, it&#39;s a lot like the identity file and these kind of make up its core personality. And so the agent will read these very often and the outputs that your agent has are dictated by what&#39;s included in these files.
(06:33)  But what we&#39;re discussing today, the main topic of what we&#39;re discussing are skills. And so skills are a little file that allows your agent to do things. And if you pair them with integrations or APIs, it can control a lot of the things that you would want to do on the on the web or on the computer.
(06:55)  The first skill that I really want to talk about today and the the first one of my seven most important skills for your Claudebot/openclaw agent is the notion skill. It is incredibly useful. So the first skill I want to talk about is notion. And as you can see here, if we go into our files, we can see that there is a notion skill.
(07:16) The main important document within this notion folder is this skill.md file. And I will put these files in a link in the description below. And this skill allows my agent to fully use Notion. And I&#39;m actually going to show you exactly how you can set this up in just a second. But let me show you why this is useful.
(07:38) So I&#39;m about to start a new task. Whenever I start a new task, I go slashreset. Now what I&#39;m going to do is I want to create some content on some short form content on open claw and specifically the typefully skill. Let&#39;s create a short form video. Write a draft. And here it&#39;s actually it&#39;s getting ahead of itself because it wants to be able to post this on typefully.
(08:07)  And I&#39;m just going to say we&#39;re just using notion for now. Don&#39;t post on X. We&#39;ll get to that skill later. I like the angle of number one. Let&#39;s use use that. Create a notion doc for this page for this script. And so Vibe Claw, which is the name of this agent, that&#39;s what it goes by. It&#39;s it shows content bot.
(08:30)  I&#39;m going to change its name to content-vibe claw because that&#39;s kind of the name of like how I organize. So all of my quadbots are going to be like a variation of vibe claw because they&#39;re all going to share the same notebook. I actually don&#39;t want to dive into this right now. I think that could get a little bit confusing.
(08:46) But right now it&#39;s creating a notion document. And whenever it creates a notion document, it&#39;s going to return a link to that notion document so I can open it up right away. And look at this. Boom. So here it is. So, I can just click on this link right here, and it&#39;s going to just open up the document.
(09:01)  And you can see that it put it in its content notebook. It put it in its content notebook, and it is right here. And so, here it says, I built an AI agent that writes all my tweets for me. And no, it doesn&#39;t sound like a robot. Posting on Twitter is is currently exhausting. So, as you can see here, it actually wrote the script.
(09:20)  And we can just keep going. Like, please don&#39;t include headers ever when creating content. Please put this in the notes and please give me three other options for hooks based on my other higherforming short form videos. And you can see it made a change and it got remove it removed those headers for me. It&#39;s just doing it and then it should create some other options for hooks based on my other high-erforming videos.
(09:52) And so it put them, it shows me here and it says option A, I replace 45 minutes of daily work with an AI agent that cost me nothing and it&#39;s open source. Nobody&#39;s talking about this, but AI agents are about to replace your entire social media workflow. B, that is great. Use that.
(10:10)  And we&#39;re kind of just like working on this with the agent, which is really fun. And there you go. It updated. Nobody&#39;s talking about this, but AI agents are about to replace your entire social media workflow. I set up an AI agent called OpenClaw on my computer and gave it a skill that connects to Typfully, which is the app that I use to schedule all my tweets.
(10:27) Now, every single day, my agent automatically drafts tweets for me. I know it&#39;s my voice. I know it&#39;s my audience, and it drops them straight into Titefully as drafts, which a is exactly in my voice. That&#39;s exactly how I speak. And why did it ha why was it able to write in my voice? Let me show you.
(10:48)  I want to show you skill number four. We&#39;re going out of order just because I can, right? I&#39;m going to go in a natural order. This came up. We have a skill called transcript extractor. Let&#39;s say for a second here that I am Kane Callaway, one of my favorite content creators and one of my good friends in the content space.
(11:06)  Let&#39;s say I&#39;m Kane Callaway. And so I just went through and I grabbed five of his most popular videos and ones that I really, really like. What I can do is I&#39;m going to say please can you create a notion page in your notes and extract these scripts so that we can reference them later, put them in notion.
(11:29)  So now we&#39;re using two skills in one. The skill that we&#39;re using right now is transcript extractor. If you ask your Claudebot to extract the transcript from an Instagram video, it&#39;s not going to be able to. It doesn&#39;t know which API to use. But since I already know that with the super data API, I created a skill that now pulls the transcript from any video on social media, which I&#39;ll show you in just a second.
(11:55)  But the point is right now it&#39;s extracting all of these reels with over 1 million views and extracting the transcript and putting it in notion so that in the future if I ever say create a video like Callaway, it&#39;ll reference this page in my notion and it will create a video in his voice which is really cool because the most important thing with AI agents is making sure that you collect a ton of relevant context.
(12:18) Boom. Got all five transcripts. Let&#39;s create a notion page. We can click on this open it created a notion doc and here are all of the scripts. Now I can say okay in the content notebook please create three script options for quadbot/openclaw write a video on why it&#39;s cool in the style of callaway.
(12:46)  Now it has relevant context because it has this document in your notion now and you can reference it later. Oh, I don&#39;t think I ever mentioned. Okay, I never mentioned that this was Callaway. I&#39;m going to say the rename the uh notion page that you just made as Callaway short form scripts. That&#39;s who the creator is.
(13:09)  And put in the when to use whenever I want a video in the style of Cain Callaway, use this notebook. and we can run it and it&#39;ll change the name of it and it will change this when to use thing right here. There you go. It operates pretty quickly. Uh reference and writing scripts like Callaway style use these transcript for tone pacing hooks and structure.
(13:28)  That&#39;s exactly what we wanted. And now we&#39;re done. And so that is a really useful thing. And so that&#39;s how I got it to scrape all of my content on all of these platforms. And so here we have Rick Muple. Rick Muple is another agent that I just it&#39;s running in the cloud. I&#39;ll explain how that works at the end of the video.
(13:49)  It&#39;s a cloudbot running on a virtual computer and I&#39;m going to show you how you can set up both of these skills just so you understand that you can do it with natural language. So, we&#39;re going to first set up the notion skill. I want to set up a skill that allows you to fully use my notion. Please give me an inline link to whatever keys you need from me.
(14:14)  In order to give it access to your notion, you need some sort of API key which acts as a gateway or uh it is a key to get into your notion. And so you need to create it. And so what I like to I just want Claudebot to give me the link exactly where I can find that. And so if we open up the link that it gave me, we can see here that we have an integration for Vibe Claw already, which gives this Claudebot access, but this Claudebot doesn&#39;t have access.
(14:42)  You can create a new key or we can go into Vibe Claw. And here you can see the key right here. Remember, keep these secret. You do not want to show these to anyone. So here I&#39;m going to say, here is my key. Please use this and create the skill. I will paste it in my next message. Okay? And so I gave it my key.
(15:01)  I&#39;m covering it up here with a screenshot. When it says done, key stored and verified working. I can see your workspace. I found pages like key docs, the AI agent that runs my business, etc., etc. Just remember, I can only access pages and database that I&#39;ve have connected to your integration. If you go to the access tab, you need to actually enable what it can do.
(15:21)  And so, I only have one workspace. So, I just enabled. You can hit edit access. and you just enable whatever workspace you want this specific integration to have access to and then it created that skill. And so now let&#39;s test it. Please uh create a document in the notebook that explains how you set up this integration. Let&#39;s just see if it works.
(15:45) Here we go. Done. Created this doc in key docs. Right? It put it in key docs. Like it just put it here at the bottom. My other agent puts it in the Vibe Claw notebook because that&#39;s part of the skill. And so this is actually a good lesson. And this is important to note when you&#39;re when you&#39;re building out skills, right? You&#39;re just talking to an employee.
(16:06)  It just did something that I didn&#39;t want it to do. So all I need to say, hey, you put it in key docs. From now on, when I tell you to create a doc, put it in the vibe claw notebook. Unless it&#39;s content, then put it in the content notebook. Uh, then move the one you just did. You said, &quot;Got it. Found both notebooks. Vibclaw notebook.
(16:31)  Let me move the integration dock to the vibe not notebook and save this preference.&quot; Now, when you say, and this is where you should let your like intellectual curiosity, if you actually want to use this productively, you should be very curious about what this means. Let me move the integration doc to Vivecloud notebook and save this preference.
(16:48) Right? This might make sense if you&#39;re talking to employee, but you can see exactly what this means. Be curious enough to ask when you say you saved this preference, tell me exactly what you mean simply like what changes were made. And you can see here it added it to this notion doc Rick Mupal notion integration.
(17:16)  And here it shows it explains it exactly when I said when you save this preference tell me exactly what you mean like what changes remain. I edited my tools.mmd file. That&#39;s a file in my workspace that I read at the start of each session. I added a note that says general docs put in vibeclaw notebook content scripts put in the content notebook.
(17:34)  So next time you ask me to create a doc I&#39;ll remember which notebook to use without you having to tell me. And if you want to be even more curious, you can go to cursor and you can see that in the tools.m MD file, if we look up notebook, you can see exactly that, right? You can see that it has this primary content database content notebook.
(17:55)  This is exactly what he just mentioned and it explains everything. And so you just have to have the more curiosity you have about the agent, the more you&#39;re deeply going to understand how it works, how it operates, why it does certain things. So I highly recommend really paying attention to this. Okay.
(18:11)  So now I&#39;m going to show you how to set up the transcript extractor skill. And I&#39;m not going to go as far into detail uh showing you exactly how to set up all of them from here on out. I just do want to show you these two so that you get the general idea on how it works. I think this one is just a really good example because it uses an API key that I think is really useful.
(18:31)  It uses this external service called super data and I learned this through vibe coding. I&#39;ve made multiple apps vibe coding using the super data API. It&#39;s been really useful. Any useful API that you&#39;ve used vibe coding is probably useful when building an AI agent, right? giving it access to tools that can convert an Instagram link into a transcript to that video is very useful for ads, for uh if you&#39;re running a UGC operation at your company, if you uh just want to extract all of your content, all of your competitor&#39;s
(19:00) content. The list goes on and on. It&#39;s incredibly useful and you can do this on any platform. And so the service that I&#39;ve known is called Super Data. So, I want to create a skill that extracts content transcripts on all platforms. Please search super data API and learn what you can do with this.
(19:26)  Then I&#39;ll give you my API key and you should create a skill that allows you to always extract any transcript from the platforms that super data allows. I&#39;ll give you the key below. Do research in the meantime. So here I can just go to supera data super data API and here it is. YouTube transcript API for makers. We can just sign in.
(19:57)  And here it immediately shows my API key. And here it shows my usage the last few days. We&#39;ve ran it about 115 times. So we&#39;ve pulled my agent has pulled about 115 and I believe it&#39;s like 15 bucks a month for 3,000 of these. So it&#39;s not that crazy. And so all I need to do is copy this API key. And I&#39;m going to paste it here.
(20:19) Here is the key. fully create and test this skill. I want you to always use this when video content is useful. Transcripts provide great context. So now it can just use this as a skill. So I&#39;m going to pause the video and paste the key. Okay, here we go. So it&#39;s done. From now on, whenever a URL would provide useful context, I will pull the transcript.
(20:49)  And so the best way to test if skills work is to reset the chat. And this will create a new session. We&#39;re using Opus 4.5. You can do this. What I love about I just love Telegram&#39;s uh commands. You can even create new commands which are really cool. But actually, I have one saved to my clipboard. I just pasted a link to a YouTube video.
(21:09)  Please uh summarize this video. Then add a document to your notebook in Notion explaining it. Please at the bottom include the full transcript for the video. And here it says uh page created. Now adding the content. Please always give me the link to the notion doc when you create one. This is one thing that I did on my main cloudbot.
(21:36)  Uh when you create a doc, please always give me the link. And I just think it&#39;s useful. Like I don&#39;t want to have to go find it. It should just give me the link and I should be able to open it up right here. And by the way, this all works on your phone. I can immediately ask it to create a document.
(21:51)  It&#39;ll create whatever document and then send me the link. I can immediately open it up, which opens up the app on my phone, which is super useful. And so, here we go. Here is this interview. And where&#39;s the transcript? Here&#39;s the full transcript to the video. And because we gave it access to super data, it can do this with Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, all of it.
(22:10)  Now, we&#39;ve given the agent power to grab relevant context. And you can use this at any time. You don&#39;t need to go to some random site that you see on the internet with a bunch of ads and maybe viruses. You can just tell your agent to do it for you. Give it a link. Boom. Okay. So, now let&#39;s move on to the next script, which is the ability to use Twitter.
(22:29)  So, on Twitter, you can actually draft tweets, schedule tweets, and post tweets with the Typefully API. Let me show you what I mean by this. I just made a video that I want to post on Twitter. Let&#39;s create a video then get it on X with a great caption. Okay, so here it automatically created a notion database.
(22:55) So all I need to do is just click on this or it created a notion document and now I can actually paste my video and I did record a video like right before this and so all I need to do is just drag my video in here. another skill. And I actually didn&#39;t even include this in the video as one of the skills that it has.
(23:13)  All I need to do is say, I just uploaded it. Go for it. It&#39;s actually going to pull that video from Notion, use the Gemini API, analyze it, then it&#39;s going to look at my really popular captions. Right? On Twitter, you don&#39;t just post a video, you post it with some text. It&#39;s going to look at all of my high performing videos and then it&#39;s going to come up with a a caption or multiple options for a caption for this video, then draft it on Tfully.
(23:38)  It&#39;s going to do all of this in kind of one skill, which is this typefully skill. And here we go. So, it analyzed the video and now it came up with five Twitter captions. So, here, this is incredible. Claude has built an entire iOS app from a single prompt. Pokemon style habit tracker with custom AI art leveling up and $4.
(24:00) 99 subscription all on Vibe Code then straight to the app store. And so this is exactly what that video was about. If we go back to notion, we can see that we created &gt;&gt; build any professional mobile app with a front end, a back end, a database and payments and you can get it into the app store in one sitting.
(24:16)  All you have to do is type and then the app that I made was exactly what it described and now I can say okay I love option two. Let&#39;s draft it up. And look at this. It said done. Created with the video attached. We can click on this, open it up. And would you look at this? We have This is incredible.
(24:37)  Claude just built an entire iOS app from a single prompt. Pokemon style habit tracker with custom AI art, etc., etc. It gave us five different options, and it&#39;s ready to publish directly to Twitter using the Typefully API. And again, if you want to create this up, you just need to go to settings in tightfully once you&#39;ve signed up and you can find your API key and you can control all of the accounts that you have access to.
(25:03)  I can tell it to post from any of these accounts. By default, it&#39;s mine and it&#39;s only going to create draft, but I could have had it post directly to Twitter, which is really cool. So, the next skill that I think is one of the most useful is the linear skill. So, we use linear as a project management platform.
(25:21)  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really show you a demo of this because this is where all of our sensitive company information is. But Linear is just a platform that keeps track of tasks, right? It keeps track of tasks and you have a bunch of different tasks in very similar to notion. Linear is very easy to set up.
(25:39)  You can just ask it, hey, I want to create a linear skill. Please give me the link that I need to go to to get the key and I&#39;ll give it to you and I want you to be able to read linear. And you can give it uh read access and write access. So you can give it read and write access. So maybe you don&#39;t want to risk messing anything up.
(26:00)  So you&#39;ll say you should have only read access. You don&#39;t want to be able to write access because it is it is really useful to just be able to read like what tasks do I need to do? What tasks is Muhammad doing? What tasks is Kevin doing? um out of and then you could say things like please summarize all of the tasks that I need to do and in your opinion which ones are the most difficult how long do you think this will take? You can ask really good questions and this is really helpful when I&#39;m write uh trying to plan content in the future because my job as a
(26:29) marketer at vibecode.dev I need to make content on new features that we create. So, I can say, &quot;Please create a content calendar of all of the new features that are shipping over the next month.&quot; And it will completely analyze everything in linear and come up with a good content calendar.
(26:45)  And that&#39;s really, really useful. I just can&#39;t really show you examples because all of that information is very private and uh belongs to the company. So, I can&#39;t really show any examples of that. Skill number five that I want to show you is one that I created today and I thought it was really cool and a good example of me do creating a skill on my phone from Telegram.
(27:06)  And this is the exact conversation. I said, &quot;Please create a nano banana pro skill. Here is the key. I edited this message. I had the key here. I want you to use a photo of me. I will give you to replace the person in the thumbnails.&quot; Blah blah blah blah blah. And it said, and it couldn&#39;t find Nanobanana.
(27:22)  And I was like, &quot;Nanobanana, search the internet by Google.&quot; And it&#39;s like, &quot;I found it.&quot; blah blah blah blah blah found it. Nano banana. Okay, amazing. Okay. And then I basically told it earlier before this before this I told it to create this PDF for me and this PDF went out and did YouTube research on Claudebot and it just scraped the top 40 thumbnails from YouTube.
(27:48)  And this is used in the SER API which is one of the skills that I have. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s in this video. It might be the next one actually. But it was able to just pull all of the highquality thumbnails from popular YouTube videos on Cloudbot. And so then I basically went on and said, I want you to basically recreate the PDF and replace the person in the thumbnails with my face.
(28:12)  Look up how to do this with Nano Banana. So it&#39;s goal was to create a new report where all of those images in this PDF were replaced with my face. And guess what? It did it. So, I had it test it with just two. So, here&#39;s the PDF that it gave me. It tested it with two. So, if you look at the first two thumbnails, this one and this one, it replaced my face.
(28:39)  It put my face on these thumbnails. It just did it right. And I tested it with two, right? I didn&#39;t want to spend all of those tokens replacing all of them if it did it incorrectly. And then I said, &quot;Okay, now do the whole PDF.&quot; It said, &quot;Hold my beer.&quot; And here it is. It took all 40 of those videos and put my face on it.
(28:58)  As you can see here, it put my face on this thumbnail. I actually really like this. Probably change the hair a little bit, but like I don&#39;t sleep, so you can. Very good thumbnail. It even put me on the quadbot, which is hilarious. And it put my face on all of these thumbnails. And so this is a a skill that I created called thumbnail mood board.
(29:21)  And so I would just say thumbnail mood board. I&#39;m creating a video on how to use the notion MCP. And it would search it, find 20 thumbnails because you can see in my follow-up qu uh question, I said, &quot;Okay, I would like to create a skill that does this with some modifications. I want it to be a PDF of just 20.
(29:40) &quot; And then what was really cool is um it asks me follow-up questions. Like I said, I will give you the topic. Please ask more info on the topic if I don&#39;t give it. And then it said, &quot;Should I always use the selfie you already sent me or should I ask for a new photo each time?&quot; Which is a really good question.
(29:57)  And so I just said, &quot;Use the selfie I gave unless I give you another one.&quot; And now it I have the ability to just create one of these. I don&#39;t want to do it because it takes like 20 minutes and I don&#39;t want to wait that long, but I could do it right now. And I could just say use the thumbnail mood board skill.
(30:14)  And it would just create a PDF. It also asked another really good question. It says, &quot;Do you want me to include the original thumbnail of the creator?&quot; And I said, &quot;Oh, good question. Include both the raw and the edited. I like that.&quot; And then it said, &quot;Done. Thumbnail mood board skill is built.
(30:29) &quot; And so we can go into cursor and we can see that the we have this skill which is thumbnail mood board. And it outlines exactly how to use it, which is really cool. So now on my morning walk to work, I created this skill that now I can use this at any time when I want to think about what thumbnails I want to add. I can just pull them from YouTube, add my face, and then this is what I&#39;ll send my YouTube uh thumbnail editor because I do have a human thumbnail editor because I want to make like the highest quality thumbnails, and I can just circle the
(30:57) one that I want to do, and he can make many different variations or he can copy multiple from this document, which I think is really useful. All right, the sixth skill before we get to the the seventh, which is absolutely my favorite skill, is a is a simple one. This is a Google images skill.
(31:13)  So, we just reset the chat. Please uh create a short form script on notion about the potential acquisition of Quadbot/openclaw by Meta. Please create it in my style. Also, I want you to add Google images relevant images to the script and just a very simple skill. Some of these skills are very easy. And I used the SER API, SE RP API, in order to give it the power to very quickly search Google images and find them.
(31:49)  And it can actually place those images in the notion docs that it creates, which I found incredibly useful because it just provides relevant images in the writing that you create. And it&#39;s done writing that script. So we can just click on this. We can open this up. And here we can see that there are images attached to this.
(32:07)  And so it&#39;ll find relevant images and it&#39;ll say, &quot;Check this out. Meta might be about to acquire one of the fastest growing AI agent platforms on the planet. It&#39;s called Open Claw. And if you haven&#39;t heard of it, you will soon.&quot; That&#39;s a pretty good hook and it just provides relevant images.
(32:22)  So I think this is a useful, very simple skill. Okay, so for my final skill and my favorite skill that I created yesterday that just put me in a huge flow state using this AI agent and I just really really loved it is called take the wheel. I want to create a uh long form video in my style about how to use about how to use AI agents for vibe coding apps and vibe coding agents like Quadbot. Take the wheel.
(32:55)  So when I say take the wheel, it triggers this skill. Okay. So, what this is going to do is it&#39;s going to basically flip the agent and it&#39;s going to start becoming significantly more urgent and it&#39;s going to circle around the next thing that we need to do, right? Because I said I want to create a long form style.
(33:13)  You can see like what&#39;s the core angle, tutorial, workflow, demo, or thought leadership. Answer that and I&#39;ll nail the hook outline structure. So, now it&#39;s much more urgent and all I need to do from now on is just answer its questions and it&#39;s going to take it to completion. My biggest problem with AI is it&#39;s very reactive.
(33:31)  I still have to provide the agency and push the agent. And so if we&#39;re working with many different agents here and they&#39;re all operating under take the wheel, all it&#39;s going to do is just prompt me, ask me questions. And so here I can say what&#39;s the core angle? The core angle is like Claudebot is the next iteration of vibe coding because it&#39;s similar skill set with agents, APIs and other things.
(34:01)  And the angle is that people need to learn how to do all of it and level up. And so I just answered its question and it&#39;s going to continue this process where it responds in bursts. Part of this skill is that it will always put the most important question in all caps. Okay, level up video. Vibe coding was step one.
(34:21)  AI agents are step two. Cloud point is the proof point. Now I need to know the audience level. Your YouTube has 180K subs, a mix of beginner people already vibe coding. Are we are we assuming they already know what vibe coding is or are we catching people up who are still on the sidelines who and then it always puts in all caps the most important thing like if I didn&#39;t want to read all of this it just puts in all caps what the question I need to answer is but it puts the rest of this stuff because it it&#39;s such like it basically
(34:50) circles around this question if that makes sense. And so all I need to do is just answer this question and look at these other messages here for other contexts that might jog my memory. So these people may have heard of vibe coding but not necessarily gotten started and we can teach them claude code to make web apps, mobile apps then cloudbot.
(35:18)  Now we answer the question and again our super urgent take the wheel agent is going to respond. So this is a full journey v uh video beginner friendly. You&#39;ve already heard of vibe coding. Now let me show you the whole stack etc etc. That&#39;s a meaty video. This could easily be 20 to 30 minutes which brings me to the next thing.
(35:35)  Are you actually building something on camera? Scripted talking head. Yes. polished intro followed by examples of me building a web app, mobile app, and then creating an agent with Claudebot. You can do all of this on Vibe Code. So, we will use the platform, but the focus is on the concepts and teaching people how to do this. Perfect.
(36:03)  Polish video script intro live builds platform vibe code dev. We&#39;re not making it feel like a product demo. It&#39;s education first. Okay. I need to nail the intro. I&#39;ve studied your style. The bold hook, bold claim, viewer pain, FOMO, reassurance, clear premise. What&#39;s the emotional angle for the hook? Which one hits harder for you? I think I like the FOMO angle, but make it sound like this video will fully catch someone up to speed on the topic of agents and vibe coding.
(36:35)  So, yeah, I&#39;m just answering all of these questions. It&#39;s very urgent. So, you know, you get this feeling of urgent and it&#39;s going to take it to completion. It knows and it also has examples of highquality long- form video scripts in its notion document. So, it knows what high quality is. That&#39;s really important.
(36:53)  And so, that&#39;s how it&#39;s able to answer the right questions. And it says, &quot;Okay, let me start building this out in notion now.&quot; So, I just answered four questions. It has so much context about me that it&#39;s going to be able to create this this script, the intro and the outline almost completely and I&#39;ll be ready to start this video if this is a video that I I really want to create.
(37:15)  And boom, here it created this document. We can full screen this. And there you go. It gave me the link as well. It always gives me the link. And here it goes. Right now there&#39;s a massive shift happening in tech that most people are completely missing. Everyone is talking about AI. Everyone is talking about vibe coding. But almost nobody understands the full picture.
(37:33)  They think vibe coding is just asking chat GBT to write some code. And then I I like this. This sounds like me. Um here&#39;s what I mean. Level one is using AI to help you build apps, web apps, mobile apps, and things that used to take months uh and entire dev teams. You can now build these in hours with the right tools.
(37:47)  Most people have heard of this. Some people are doing it. But level two is where things get really interesting. Level two is AI agents. These are not chat bots. These are autonomous systems that run 24/7. make decisions, take actions, and operate like a member of your team. I have one running uh my marketing right now. It wakes up every morning, checks my content, it&#39;s literally describing what the agent does, and this is really cool.
(38:08) It has clear outline sections, and that is a very high quality script. And so, we&#39;re done. All I need to do to turn it off, like this is this could get annoying, but that&#39;s the point. The point is that I want it res I want it messaging me. I want it sending me notifications, making sure that I get the thing done.
(38:26)  And that&#39;s what take the wheel does. No matter what task it is, I could say I could reset this and I could say I am I need 20 add scripts in the notion. There are examples of scripts. I need 20 soon. Please take the wheel. And that&#39;s all I need to say. And then it&#39;ll go from this very simp like this is how it sounds normally but as soon as I use the skill take the wheel it just turns into just like let&#39;s get this done.
(38:56)  It&#39;s like a just someone who&#39;s extremely urgent like there&#39;s a deadline coming up very soon and we can actually take a look into what the skill looks like. So the take the wheel script it basically says you are now the leader. The user is handing you control of the current task. When the user says take the wheel, identify the task at hand from recent conversation context.
(39:17)  Determine what information is missing or what decisions need to be made. Ask the single most critical question that moves the task forward. Asking after asking, add a clear nudge like answer that, etc. And I will specific next action, right? And it&#39;ll do things like ask one question at a time, burst messaging, sound urgent, reframe relentlessly.
(39:38)  That&#39;s what I really like. You know, reframing is a lot is really useful. It&#39;s not going to ask a bunch of separate questions, which AI does. Like, it&#39;s like before we get started, answer these four questions. That&#39;s annoying. No, I want one question, but reframe it. Ask questions around it.
(39:54)  And then it it puts in all caps the most important part of the question that I need to answer. So, if I don&#39;t want to like look at all the reframing, I can just look at the one in all caps. And then all I have to do is basically just answer these questions. So I&#39;m looking at the ad batch from February 6th which is a recent uh set of ads that we&#39;ve done which performed incredibly well.
(40:13)  Um and so here it&#39;s like same mix as before or do you want me to hit uh different angles? Okay. And then now we&#39;re in the same process to create ads and then at the end it would create a notion document with all of the scripts. And so I I think this is my favorite skill because it just creates a sense of urgency and I know that all I need to do is answer some questions and we&#39;re gonna have like a really really good starting point for whatever task it is that we are working on.
(40:37)  And so yeah, that&#39;s a basic overview of all of the skills that I use uh for the agent. And again, I&#39;ve only been working on this for a few days and I&#39;m going to be adding many other agents, right? We&#39;re going to have an operator agent, a hiring agent. We&#39;re going to have an agent that has access to all of the basically what apps people are making.
(40:56) So, it will be able to inform my content. It&#39;ll be able to inform our priorities as a company. And so, my goal is to have like five or six agents based on all the hats I wear, right? I&#39;m a startup founder, which means I&#39;m hiring people for marketing, but I&#39;m also doing content. I&#39;m a content creator.
(41:12)  It means I&#39;m also a manager of the people in my company. And so, there&#39;s a lot of different hats that I have to wear. and I want an agent for each of those hats, but all of them are going to share a shared notebook, which is my notion. And so that&#39;s kind of a way that they can all get shared context, but they&#39;re not necessarily going to have the same skills because the more skills you add, the less effective it becomes because it it stops knowing what skills to use.
(41:38) Like I don&#39;t recommend creating an agent with a thousand skills. It just it will not become an agent tailored for outputs. it&#39;ll just be a chaotic mess. That&#39;s one of the the main realizations I have about all of this is you want to make sure that your agent knows what to do.
(41:55)  You want to make it more predictable. You want it to be useful. You want it to be able to go off and do anything if you ask, but you don&#39;t want it to just do things randomly, or else your life is just going to get more chaotic and you&#39;re likely not going to save any time. But anyway, that&#39;s my agent. I hope you guys like this video.
(42:10) I&#39;ll see you here for the next
