Transcript:
(00:00) How can you make money from OpenClaw? Like, how can you spin up these OpenClaw instances, these sub agents, these digital employees that can go out and make you money while you sleep? Is it even possible? Well, in today&#39;s episode, I brought on Nick, and he shows a tactical tutorial for how to spin up multiple Open Claw machines in a virtual instance, how you can be automating tasks on Upwork and these boring business automations, and how you can actually make money from OpenClaw.
(00:31)  If this doesn&#39;t get your creative juices flowing for the future of SAS, how people are going to make money and how to actually use Open Claw from not just a cute little use cases, but actually money-m uh opportunities, then I don&#39;t know what will. I had such a good chat with Nick. It got my creative juices flowing.
(00:51)  I think it will yours, too. And this is, I think, one of Nick&#39;s first podcast. So give him a like and comment to juice him up because he shared that sauce. &gt;&gt; I couldn&#39;t be more excited to have Nick on the pod. He&#39;s one of my go-to people when I have questions about OpenClaw. Nick, by the end of this episode, what are people going to learn? Yeah, people are going to learn that OpenClaw is more than just a personal assistant.
(01:28)  You can actually deploy this into businesses. You could drive actual business outcomes, generate revenue off of OpenClaw as an opportunity. Um, and yeah, we&#39;re seeing it on X like people who are deploying OpenClaw for um kind of executives or um individuals who are super busy. uh they&#39;re making thousands of dollars, you know, setting OpenClaw up, getting it up and running for these people and managing it for them.
(01:52)  So, I think there&#39;s a huge opportunity here and yeah, just excited to jump in. Cool. And before we get going, I need you to make a commitment to me and to the person listening or watching, which is I need you not to hold back any sauce. I don&#39;t want to know just about the opportunity.
(02:09)  I want to know how are people doing it tactically. And by the end of this episode, what I want is for people to take away like I want people to know how they can actually make a dollar from this. And is that a commitment, Nick, that you are willing to make to to us? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. I I&#39;m not going to hold back anything.
(02:30)  I I&#39;m I&#39;ve in fact I think OpenClaw is is a is a tool that allows us to be able to do the things that we have always been able to make money from like automation with AI but do it even better and I&#39;m going to show you how to get it all set up so you can do that and the wedge to get going. So &gt;&gt; let&#39;s do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah.
(02:51)  So I guess jumping right in as far as like getting set up with OpenClaw. You can see here you know this is Orgo. This is our startup. You don&#39;t have to use Orgo to get started with OpenCloud. Just full disclaimer, this is what I&#39;m using. And what I&#39;m going to do is I have a project here. Uh you can see I have a couple a couple projects and I have Greg. I set you up a project.
(03:09)  I hope I hope you uh enjoy your, you know, five computers. Um, and so you can imagine, Greg, you, let&#39;s say you&#39;re a business owner and you have a busy life, you know, um, you got all you have the podcast going on. You have all these businesses you&#39;re running, the agency, the idea browser, all this stuff, and and you need you need help automating some stuff.
(03:32)  So, what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to come in. I&#39;m Scrappy Nick. I&#39;m going to come in and I&#39;m going to help automate some things in your in your business, in your life, um, you know, as a busy executive. and I&#39;m going to get you set up with OpenClaw. So, when you open up a computer here, you can see I have it open.
(03:49)  This is the the Clawbot um computer I made for you. If I actually just type in OpenClaw TUI, this will open up OpenClaw in the terminal. And you can see I I actually already started like, hey, I&#39;m Greg Eisenberg. And it&#39;s all ready to get set up. And so, actually, what I could do is um I could invite you to this project.
(04:10)  And then you would be able to do this as well, like in your terminal, you&#39;d be able to spin this up and now you&#39;re talking to Open Claw. So, um, super easy to get set up. Once again, you don&#39;t have to use Orgo. You could use whatever you want. You could use, I know, uh, Manis just dropped their, uh, their own version of like one-click deployment OpenClaw.
(04:29)  Um, also, Kimmy launched their version as well. X is down right now, so we can&#39;t actually pull it up on Twitter or anything, but, uh, Kimmy launched their version. And so, uh, there&#39;s all these options as far as getting started. You could use a Mac Mini, whatever. So, the key here, Greg, with OpenClaw and actually creating money from it is to have the wedge to know what is the specific use case in a person&#39;s business that we&#39;re going to automate like first because for when when you see open call on Twitter, it&#39;s very much a personal
(04:58) assistant. It&#39;s exciting. It&#39;s fun. But all the demos that go viral, including me, I get it. I I&#39;m I&#39;m guilty of this, too. All the all the demos that go viral are a little bit, you know, kind of toyish. They&#39;re a little flashy, but the the real power is in finding the thing that actually, you know, drives business outcomes, saves time for a business, finding that and and building the automation around that.
(05:26)  So, I have something running here. This is my open claw doing looking up products for uh a business that I uh deployed for this is a a promotional distributorship. And what this is doing is it&#39;s looking up products and actually downloading all the product information and then like parsing all that information.
(05:48)  There&#39;s all these reports it needs to download and then uploading that into a Zoho CRM. um so it can essentially you know create a central source of truth for this client. So this is a perfect example here of like actually creating a agent you that openclaw deploys to be able to automate something end to end.
(06:12)  Um so just just to recap are we all good so far? &gt;&gt; Yeah so a few things I I just want to talk about. So one thing is when you showed you know that orgo screen you did you had like five machines running. So what&#39;s interesting is you know I&#39;ve got my Mac Mini going you know I&#39;ve got one instance so using something like this is cool um because you can have multiple instances going right and you can see them all in one screen in one view.
(06:41)  So that&#39;s really cool that that was sort of an aha moment for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely. Yeah, it&#39;s like everyone, you know, as far as where you deploy your your main open claw, you can see here I like I starred the main one. &gt;&gt; Uh, and so that&#39;s like you could have that wherever.
(06:59)  But what people don&#39;t realize is openclaw can spawn sub agents &gt;&gt; and I think this is going to be huge for people who start like right right now we&#39;re at the phase of having one open claw. It&#39;s going to happen quickly. you&#39;re already seeing on it on Twitter memes about like, oh, what if you have a, you know, 10 Mac minis or all the Mac Studios are being bought out.
(07:19)  So, this is happening fast where you&#39;re going to want 10 open claws, you know, 100 open claws. Right now, you could have one open claw and just have it spawn up to, I think, eight sub aents and each sub aent could have its own computer. And you could do this like this is why this is like kind of where orgo shines is you could spin up multiple computers for, you know, each individual sub agent of your open claw.
(07:41)  And in this case here, I had it looking on Upwork for actual things that we could automate with OpenClaw. This is like a little hack here as far as like, well, I want to make money with OpenClaw. Well, uh, oh, I don&#39;t know any any business that I could reach out to that could automate stuff for. A great place to start is Upwork because there&#39;s jobs on Upwork that are literally posted.
(07:59)  They&#39;re they&#39;re asking you. They&#39;re like, &quot;I want to pay 500, a,000, 1,500, 3,000, $20,000 for this AI workflow, and you can I spawned sub, it went viral on Twitter. I spawned sub agents to go find all these jobs and then build out little demos for each of them, and and then we picked the best one, and okay, let&#39;s let&#39;s apply for that proposal with that.
(08:22) &quot; So, that&#39;s a little tidbit there on on Upwork and all of that. So, which is which is kind of hilarious because I mean Upwork, you know, is designed for human beings to complete work, right? It&#39;s not designed for machines, let alone multiple machines to complete work. Um, but I mean, as long as the the quality of work is good, um, you know, customers going to be happy, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah.
(08:47)  And I think like it&#39;s good to, you know, it&#39;s good to treat it as a as a starting point. like you know if you can save time preparing a proposal for a job on Upwork it&#39;s like um what is that worth you know and if you could do just a 100x volume uh what is that worth so there&#39;s a couple things on that of like the parallelization of work with openclaw so there&#39;s like could you have 10 open claws working on a given task and it breaks up that tasks into 10 subtasks and so each open claw does one of those subtasks that&#39;s one way of
(09:17) having parallelization but Another way is to have 10 open claws working on the same task uh just 10 different instances of it. And that was kind of like what I was doing here. It&#39;s you know four different instances of the one open claw that you know or four different open claws doing the same thing of looking up different jobs on Upwork that they could apply to.
(09:39)  So that&#39;s kind of an interesting topic there. Um but yeah, so like as far as OpenCloud goes, it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s uh a huge opportunity. I just want to like throw this in here. Andre and Horowitz talks about computer use agents. I view open claw as a computer use agent. You know, you&#39;re giving an agent a computer and it&#39;s able to do it&#39;s able to use that computer.
(10:01)  It&#39;s like it&#39;s a computer use agent. But that&#39;s half the story. The other half of the story is for it to be able to like click around actually operate a graphical user interface on like le legacy softwares and systems. And so um you can imagine like you know in here this this automation I built this is navigating a legacy platform for this client that doesn&#39;t have any clean APIs and it&#39;s able to click in download reports and actually you know be the universal API uh to be able to solve problems that you couldn&#39;t previously
(10:31) solve without computer use agents. So I think there&#39;s a huge opportunity here and and Horwitz they talk about it and they say we believe that the properly uh to properly verticalize computer use agents and assist companies in adopting it will be a major area of exploration for startups and this is like this to me this screams openclaw you know can you create a vertical use case for openclaw for a business and actually assist that company in adopting it I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the huge opportunity here um
(11:01) So, going back to this like workspace we have set up for you. Um, you know, with with with all the people setting up OpenClaw, you could set it up as easy as, you know, I invite Greg to this workspace. I create him a new computer. We could just do it now. &gt;&gt; OpenClaw 2. I select how much RAM.
(11:24)  Let&#39;s do let&#39;s do eight gigs. Launch that. Open that up. And then all we need now to get you set up is to get the um let me get the the curl command for open claw. I copy that from their website and then as this computer loads we&#39;ll be able to then literally just paste it into the terminal and once I see the interface pop up boom. Okay.
(11:53)  So now I&#39;m going to hit enter and now we&#39;re off to the races installing open claw. So like it&#39;s as easy as that. And I think there&#39;s this is this in and of itself as like a workspace where you can invite people and get them set up with openclaw or clawed code. I think this is like a huge a huge opportunity as well of like just there are executives right now that are like reaching out to me like law firms, insurance companies, they&#39;re like can you can I just like pay you to teach me how to use this stuff? So like that
(12:24) that&#39;s its own whole thing as well as far as like if you&#39;re savvy enough to even know how to install open claw and get it set up in the first place. Um I just think there&#39;s a huge opportunity around like just helping executives businesses adopt it. Um so yeah you can see it&#39;s as easy as this to get set up.
(12:42) And then as far as like what specific things can we can we automate with OpenClaw there&#39;s a couple it takes a little bit of a designs thinking approach. So when you go into a business let&#39;s say you find a project on Upwork and you want to you want to automate that with open call.
(13:02)  Let&#39;s say you go into a business and you&#39;re talking to the executive the decision maker and it&#39;s clear that they have things that need to be automated. Well, as far as like design thinking goes, like you need to have a a clear way of like first mapping like all the different possibilities. You can see here, this is something I did in the past of like there&#39;s all these different things that you could automate and you want to map them off two very simple metrics.
(13:26)  What is the value that we can create by automating this thing and what&#39;s the relative effort, cost and time? And so we ultimately want to start with, okay, we want to automate things with Open Claw that are high value and low effort, cost, and time. And that&#39;s like your your lowhanging fruit. Um, and so you start there.
(13:45)  And so like for for this client, this was like that this was that this was like, okay, we&#39;re looking up products on this website. We&#39;re downloading them. We&#39;re parsing all the information. Uh, that&#39;s the lowhanging fruit. So start with the design thinking approach of like okay simplest fastest to deploy and then you need to map out like the systems design around how like how is this thing going to be automated right so for this for this client she&#39;s like okay I send an email to a to a client of hers right she sends an email
(14:17) to a client and she has a presentation link with all these products okay and and all those products she needs to look all of them up and get all the information on them and then upload them into Zoho. So then your next step after identifying the opportunity is to literally like map this out. I use Figma, you can use whatever, but map out the the actual workflow process of like okay step one, step two, step three.
(14:41) What is this automation going to look like tiptoail so that we can do the whole thing? Um because with open cloud computer use now is now you can do that you can do you could do things from tip to tail. It&#39;s not like um you know it used to be where you&#39;d have to like go into a website and click a button and then it&#39;d be able to do some 50% of the whole thing but then you&#39;d have to copy that and paste that somewhere else and do it on your own.
(15:05)  Like we can do it tiptoail. Um, so quick recap, install open claw into a computer, identify the next, identify the the lowhanging fruit opportunities, the highest value opportunities, and then begin to map out what that even looks like to begin with. Couldn&#39;t you, you know, sort of, this is meta, but couldn&#39;t you use Open Claw to actually do some of the priorit prioritization on the auto automations and actually, I mean, you as a human being did the Figma, but couldn&#39;t you actually just use the open claw or cloud code or something like
(15:40) that to to help you with that? So, for example, like if you go back to the the Figma &gt;&gt; Mhm. Like you could walk into a business and basically say, &quot;Hey, I want to figure out uh what we could automate here and you do customer interviews with different people on the team. You record those customer interviews.
(16:05)  You get the transcripts. You upload the transcripts and then you say, &quot;Hey, based on that, then you&#39;re like, you can actually say, you know, you give this as a reference image.&quot; basically say like, &quot;Hey, I want to figure out which which automation opportunities have the highest amount of value, lowest amount of effort, cost, and time.
(16:25)  Give me the top three and then create, you know, Figma.&quot; And I think there&#39;s like a Figma MCP even uh that you can use and you can say like, &quot;Hey, like can you map this thing out based on these customer transcripts?&quot; Does that make does that make sense or am I &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the way to do it.
(16:45)  Like I whenever I do any kind of call with a client or like potential customer, oh my gosh, Gemini for uh for Google Meet is amazing. you have it take take all the notes and then actually that&#39;s that&#39;s how I even got because I don&#39;t know about I don&#39;t know about you Greg but sometimes when you&#39;re in these calls you kind of for you you know this this this industry you know you&#39;re in a new industry you&#39;re helping this customer you don&#39;t understand their domain expertise the lingo and so you got to go back and and like okay like
(17:12) what what was it that they said and so have the granola or Gemini notes or whatever and then literally ask it to like okay what&#39;s the stepby-step workflow and then map it out it just helps me to map it out visually. Uh but you could literally ask it, yeah, like you said, um based on this transcript, what is the the automation workflow look like? You know, step by step.
(17:33) &gt;&gt; And if you don&#39;t want to use, you know, Figma, you can also even say uh you know, do output in mermaid uh code and then you can use the mermaid code and insert that into an Excala draw or a TL draw or something like that. So uh a little pro tip there. &gt;&gt; Nice. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. And the Yeah.
(17:53) And the Figma MCP is pretty cool, too. Yeah. Definitely check that out. So, &gt;&gt; yeah. So, then once you figure out what the workflow is, right? Um this is where like you have to actually um be able to know okay how much how much can I really ask like how much can I just say like to openclaw right now hey like build this like hey build this thing and you just describe the workflow versus genuinely using something like cloud code to build out like what that workflow would look like with you know Python APIs a genuine automation
(18:30) pipeline and process that your open claw can actually just trigger upon um whenever it&#39;s like contextually relevant. So for instance, this this whole pipeline here of like going to these websites, looking at this product information, downloading the information, parsing it, uploading it to Zoho, the trigger of all of that is uh you know the open claw being CCD in an email and it seeing that email it has a link that is relevant for this type of workflow to be triggered.
(19:02)  So that that is like the thing that&#39;s like the listening event that open clock can do with like a cron job that it sets up to just like okay listen for this trigger and then once that trigger starts it can then activate the whole Python script workflow automation everything that you would need downstream of that.
(19:19)  So you&#39;re not relying too much on open claw&#39;s like um abilities in and of itself. you&#39;re more of so creating specialized AI workers under each uh underneath the open claw that it can call individually if that makes sense. &gt;&gt; You know, you talked earlier about sub agents. I think a lot of people are confused about what is a sub agent versus a task and stuff like that.
(19:42)  Can you just clearly explain that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um so sub sub aents are um I I I there&#39;s a couple ways to view them, right? So like in the context of cuz there and the reason I say there&#39;s a couple ways to view them is because there&#39;s a couple ways of using them. So in the context of like open claw you can ask it to spin up five research sub aents that all go and research some given task and and like and you know like I said earlier you could you could have it parallelize that task across you know splitting it up across each sub
(20:14) agent or having each sub aent actually go and do the same task you know across five different instances. But the next thing around sub aents is that you can actually like you said um maybe think of them in terms of skills. So if you&#39;re familiar with anthropic skills um you can have like these specialized instructions and rules along with actual code that you can provide to your agent for it to be able to go and do a given task.
(20:46)  And this is really nice um because it, you know, it gives you a very more per uh a very more powerful general purpose agent that can do many of your specific nuance tasks um across various domains. But the thing is is like I want my general agent to be freed up and uh to more so just be the orchestrator. And what if the the general agent this one right the the one I have start here can just call a sub agent like worker number four here to do a given skill that you have created.
(21:21)  So if your skill is that it goes on Twitter and finds the most viral ideas and it bookmarks them. Um rather than having your main agent do that and now you can&#39;t talk to your main agent for the next 20 minutes because it&#39;s working on that. Can it call that skill into a sub agent and have the sub agent do that? That I think is where things get really interesting and and in terms of the context of like deploying open clause for businesses.
(21:44)  I would think of everything that you have in terms of an AI automation opportunity around workflows, skills, tasks, etc. I would actually just create that as its own like specific sub agent with its own skill that that your open call could then call if that does that make sense? &gt;&gt; It does. It does. &gt;&gt; Nice.
(22:08)  Um it&#39;s it&#39;s you know I think the basic idea is like you know in layman&#39;s terms it&#39;s as soon as you have your um your open claw instance you know do something they&#39;re busy you know it&#39;s like they got to they&#39;ve got a a mug of hot coffee and so you and your your job is you want to leverage this as much as possible.
(22:33)  you don&#39;t want, you know, your agent to hold a a hot coffee. So, if if you ask it to do to move this desk into this area, you know, it it says, &quot;No, I&#39;m holding a a cup of hot coffee. I can&#39;t do that.&quot; So, what sub agents do is it basically creates leverage for your open claw and it basically says like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m you&#39;re going to create a set of sub agents who are going to be good at XYZ thing.
(22:59) &quot; And that way it frees up your your main agent to to you know as you say orchestrate to basically be the manager of the sub agents. Uh and you know what that could mean is uh like looking at um quality of work. It can mean uh checking for certain things and stuff like that. &gt;&gt; Exactly.
(23:22)  Exactly. I think that&#39;s going to be huge. You know, when when you start working with these businesses and and customers who want things to be automated once you show them what&#39;s possible, their eyes light up. They get all these ideas themselves. These are high agency people, you know, they they come up with creative ideas that they want to start implementing and and then what you realize is there&#39;s just a a huge a huge list of things that can be automated and they&#39;re excited about that.
(23:48)  And and so actually like the the ability to okay first solve a vertical specific workflow for for a customer and then that opening up their mind and then them being like oh I wonder if I could could I text this thing and it does this. This is kind of where like the whole open claw moment um is really powerful.
(24:08)  It&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s the it&#39;s the assistant like capability. It&#39;s the you know I have it I have it here. It&#39;s like what a lot of people might get confused about. Why is it that open call is so special? It&#39;s it&#39;s the ability that that it has its own computer. It&#39;s running 24/7. You can text it and you can schedule tasks and really if if we just removed OpenClaw from this card here and you just called this a really good employee, it it would just make sense be like, &quot;Oh, works 247, can code, can schedule tasks, I can text
(24:39) it, and they have their own computer.&quot; Um, so I think that&#39;s like kind of why Open Claw is exciting for a lot of people. And if it&#39;s not, you know, if some people think it&#39;s it&#39;s overhyped, you have to kind of look at the whole picture, I think, and and then you&#39;re able to really gauge it.
(24:54) &gt;&gt; So I I&#39;m certainly bought in on this on this idea that, you know, it potentially it could be be a really good employee. I think there&#39;s also cases where people aren&#39;t setting up their open claw in the right way where it ends up being a bad employee. Um, and I think, you know, that&#39;s sort of like the the issue with that is, you know, sometimes you have a bad employee because the manager, the coach essentially is is not doing a good job at giving the right context at the right time. So I think you know do you
(25:25) have any tips and tricks around um besides spinning up sub aents like how how could people listening to this if they want to go after this opportunity of um essentially verticalize you know open clause uh and automating some of these flows. How could people actually you know take their open claw from a bad employee to a good employee? Yeah, I think it comes down to let&#39;s maybe we should walk through.
(25:57)  So I know you have I was actually looking at this. So idea browser. So for everyone if you don&#39;t know Greg has this amazing product idea browser and I love this trend to this idea today Tik Tok trend tool that catches viral waves before they peak. So I was actually looking at this this morning.
(26:16)  I was like, &quot;Wow, this is actually something that you can maybe turn into a skill for an open claw to create a specialized skill around this.&quot; So, let&#39;s just do a live. Let&#39;s see. I I genuinely don&#39;t know how far can we get. Can we build this out now? Let&#39;s see if I copy all of that. And now I&#39;m here in the open claw that that we set up for you. And you can see it just got set up.
(26:38) It&#39;s it I just told it, hey, I&#39;m Greg Eisenberg. So, we&#39;re getting started. That&#39;s it. And let&#39;s just say I want to build a um a a specialized skill to be able to do the following. And I&#39;m just going to paste that entire um idea browser idea. And I&#39;m going to ask it as far as like creating these automations, creating workflows, or doing anything with OpenClaw, my number one tip is always ask it to ask you questions.
(27:09)  So, what do you need from me um to be able to build this out? Um let&#39;s create a plan. And so, a lot of people need to remember OpenClaw is like a almost a little bit of a wrapper around like clawed code in a way. Um so, let&#39;s see. Okay, cool. This is a big vision, Greg. I like it. Let&#39;s break down um a realistic build as an openclaw skill.
(27:38) So now it&#39;s saying okay I need data access I need the scope I need the niche focus um that&#39;ll shape what we build a lean skill so the first thing that we can maybe do is here in like orgo we have this playground mode and you can ask the playground agent here to do things in this computer in this this computer environment.
(28:05)  Um, so one thing I might test first is like can we get can we get this agent to even just spin up Tik Tok and just scroll Tik Tok and identify what is on the for you page of Tik Tok. So let&#39;s like maybe start there. Does that sound good? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Let&#39;s do that. Open Firefox. Go to Tik Tok. Scroll.
(28:29)  I&#39;m gonna say scroll Tik Tok looking for what the most common videos are on the for you page. Give me a summary. So, let&#39;s see how it&#39;s able to do this. So, this is using our our playground mode and boom, opens up Firefox. It&#39;s going to go to Tik Tok. And for those listening, I&#39;m just gonna talk through a little bit about what this agent in our our playground is doing.
(29:03) It&#39;s it&#39;s visually interacting with the screen. It&#39;s, you know, clicking into Firefox. It&#39;s opening up the browser. Now, it&#39;s typing in tik tok.com. It&#39;s going there. And let&#39;s see. This is always such a magical experience just watching a computer navigate the web like a human being.
(29:28) &gt;&gt; It&#39;s amazing. You know, this is Yeah, there it goes. Uh it&#39;s on it&#39;s on the it&#39;s on the homepage. And now it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going to actually scroll TikTok. It&#39;s going to probably take a screenshot of this. Get the context of based off that screenshot of what the video is about.
(29:46)  You could even see it. It has hashtags movie hashtag for you page. So, it&#39;s going to be able to infer a lot of things. Boom. It scrolls. It scrolls. It gets a popup. It&#39;s going to close out the popup. Um, but on your point, Greg, Dario Amade, the CEO of Anthropic, he just had a podcast with Doresh, and it came out a couple days ago.
(30:09)  And you know what&#39;s really interesting what he said in that in that um in that podcast? He said &gt;&gt; he said this idea of his around this data center full of brilliant um you know scientists and uh Nobel prize winners essentially his concept of what AGI will be like. He says, &quot;The constraint to getting there is computer use agents.
(30:33)  The ability to have an AI that can operate a computer like you and I can, but better. You know, interact with the visual interface, also be able to do things under the hood, kind of like cloud code.&quot; Um, this is the constraint he said. And I mean, it makes perfect sense. If if it can do anything that you and I can do on a computer, that seems like it can go pretty far.
(30:56)  Um, openclaw is like a chat GBT moment, I think, for for this kind of idea of computer use. And and and as far as like building these computer use agents out, you can see this is this is clearly working. So, we know this is possible. Um, you can build a lot of people might get confused with Orgo when they come to our site. They see computers for agents.
(31:16)  They&#39;re like, what does that mean? Well, I think they get it now. It&#39;s like okay you want your cloudbot to have its own computer but also we provide and I&#39;ll show this we provide the doc in our docs like we&#39;re actually provide the programmatic APIs so that you can create custom computer use agents that um do a given task very well. So you can bring any model.
(31:38)  You can get Kimmy 2.5 is like the super cheap um you know Chinese model. It&#39;s very good at computer use and you can give it the ability to click, drag, scroll, type in the keyboard, spin up a computer. Um and you could create specialized really fast, performant, lowcost computer use agents um using our docs.
(31:59)  And I just say that to say like as far as you know this this thing that we&#39;re doing here creating a skill around scrolling Tik Tok. Um I think that&#39;s how we can we can actually give it a shot is let&#39;s just we see this is working now. Let me just grab the ordocs and let&#39;s start building this skill out. If you didn&#39;t see here I&#39;m at the Ordo docs.
(32:18)  I click this thing called llms full.txt. This is like all the instructions for the LLM to be able to build on top of Orgo. And what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to wait for I have to probably I&#39;m going to wait for this to finish this its task and then I&#39;ll be able to tell it. Um but while this goes, Greg, you have any thoughts? Um, well, just, you know, sort of a thing I was thinking about is it sounds like when whenever you&#39;re trying to, you know, do a new automation, you start by thinking about what is a lightweight
(32:54) skill that I should create. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. What&#39;s the MVP? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you start with like a lightweight skill. Um, you test it and then from there you&#39;re probably like, &quot;Okay, here&#39;s what went wrong. here is what could be better that sort of thing &gt;&gt; right exactly just fine-tuning you know debug like I think the design thinking process around all of this is super important of like okay if I want to build a car maybe the first thing I do isn&#39;t to build the frame of the car or
(33:32) you know to build um you know the whole body of the car that&#39;s not the first the first thing I should do if I want to build a car. Well, why do I want to build a car? Well, I want to build a car to go from point A to point B. Oh, okay. So, really, maybe I should start by building a skateboard. How can we accomplish the task to get the get the dream out the dream outcome? And um and sometimes that means like starting with something that&#39;s completely different than the end state.
(34:03) Um so, this is done here. I think it interrupted itself. probably a context thing. But now we can actually what we can do. This is all live. So we&#39;re you&#39;re seeing this in real time. You can literally there&#39;s a couple ways to go about this. You can actually install cloud code into this computer and have it build out uh the automation in here or we can just ask this agent to do it for us. So let&#39;s see.
(34:32)  Um I want to build a computer use agent that does this exact thing. uh but more programmatically using the Orgo API docs and I paste that here. What do we need to get started and we send that off? All right, here we go. So, we need an Orgo API key. Here&#39;s the architecture of what we&#39;ll build. Okay, this looks good. Um orgo key, anthropic key.
(35:03)  It has all the code here. Cool. Um, you&#39;re looking at a Tik Tok video. Extract the username, video description, the category, the appropriate like count. Boom, boom, boom. Okay, cool. So, I have all these things already. And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m going to delete these keys. So, I&#39;m not worried about leaking or anything.
(35:25)  I&#39;m going to copy my Orgo API key. I&#39;m going to paste it in there. And I&#39;m going to say Orgo API key. I also have my enthropic key. Let me grab that. I&#39;m going to paste that here. Can we build this out? And so now we&#39;re going to have our our playground mode build out this computer use agent to be able to go do this thing that we just tested out.
(35:50)  We know it works. We know we can do it. Let&#39;s turn it into something that could be more programmatic, kind of like a skill. And let&#39;s give it to Claudebot so it always has access to it. &gt;&gt; The dream. &gt;&gt; The dream. It&#39;s literally any idea you have, you can just build it. &gt;&gt; And that&#39;s sort of the arbitrage opportunity, right? Especially like in our world, of course, like we&#39;re so used to this now.
(36:19)  Uh even though it&#39;s only been like two months. Uh but you know the opportunity is the vast majority of people on this planet and businesses would love to have better automation and would love to, you know, have computer use agents working for them aka really good employees working for them. Um but they don&#39;t know how.
(36:45)  And so I think which is which is cool that you&#39;re like you&#39;re showing us like some of the best practices on on how to do it. &gt;&gt; Exactly. didn&#39;t. &gt;&gt; And I think this is also like I I can imagine, you know, the the whole audience of this podcast, we&#39;re all pretty techsavvy. We know how to do things like vibe code and and and you know, play around with cloud code and be able to do these things and we take it for granted in terms of what that value is worth.
(37:10) &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; as far as like OpenClaw and the opportunity around that, I mean, OpenClaw started going viral on Twitter around two to three weeks ago. only now is it starting am I&#39;m starting to see it&#39;s starting to go viral on Tik Tok a little more mainstream. So um yeah I I just mean you know people are catching on and a lot of people still need help with getting you know up and running on this type of stuff and what you might think is oh I mean I have a basic understanding of open cloud and cloudbot and cloud code uh and you might
(37:45) under underwrite that. a lot of people find that valuable. So, being able to help businesses adopt it or just people in general, I think it&#39;s super good opportunity. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah, I think my only advice for people would be to f focus like don&#39;t be everything to everyone. Like don&#39;t don&#39;t help any every business.
(38:07) help real estate agents, for example, or like pick a vertical that maybe you have some unfair advantage for some particular reason. And that unfair advantage doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you have 20 years of experience. It might mean just that you know you want to build something for uh real estate agents cuz your mom was a real uh a real estate agent.
(38:28)  So you you know you know the customer, right? Um so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the way to do to do this. Absolutely. Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s um whatever you know that&#39;s your advantage. And I mean I guess as far as like some maybe this doesn&#39;t apply to everyone. Obviously if you&#39;re in this industry then go for it.
(38:49)  But like you know probably things to avoid things that are have a lot of like red tape like healthcare, finance, you know I recommend maybe start in something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. like you said um you know you could do even manufacturing or or uh there&#39;s a lot of distributorships out there who you know they distribute uh merchandise um just like the the demo I was showing earlier of that computer use a agent working um so yeah I I think as far as you know doing doing what you know and starting there and then the market will tell you you know the market
(39:22) will pull you into specific verticals you&#39;ll start seeing ways that as you build these spec this is a Great point. As you build out these specific workflows around these verticals of like let&#39;s say you do, you know, let&#39;s say you do the manufacturing thing and you do manufacturing for doors.
(39:40)  Um over time you&#39;re going to have a workflow for almost like every kind of thing you could imagine in that industry. And if you have the agents all built out, can you imagine you have a workspace and you invite uh you know some some new company into this workspace that uh for for automations, for manufacturing, for doors, like luxury doors and you invite them and they have all these AI employees in the workspace in Orgo set up ready to go.
(40:07)  You just see them all here and they&#39;re all ready to go. It&#39;s like you feel like you just hired not a person but a team. Um, I think that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a very near future. In fact, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything stopping us from having that right now. It&#39;s all about just, you know, who&#39;s going to go out there and and put in the work to actually do that.
(40:27)  And if you do, I think it&#39;s I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty clear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, and that&#39;s that&#39;s why I truly believe that, you know, agents are the new SAS, like you know what I mean? So, yes, I agree with the like the vision you painted. I think that, you know, in the past, you know, we created software that we would sell to these businesses and then they would have people actually, you know, press the buttons, touch the knobs to to make it useful.
(40:57)  Now, you don&#39;t you&#39;re not going to create software and invite them to the software. You&#39;re going to create agents and you&#39;re going to invite them to the agents and then the agents are going to do work that creates value for these companies. So that&#39;s the mindset shift and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s only recently actually that people have been you know I think over the last like two weeks I would say 2 3 weeks that people have been like on X talking about this um h how agents are the new SAS but I I do think that um
(41:34) like over you&#39;re going to see over the next two to three months like some really big winners um and you&#39;re going to start to see it work. So, I&#39;m excited for people listening because I think that um this is the a type of audience that will act on some of this stuff and it&#39;ll be interesting to see what what happens.
(41:54) &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I I think it was it was it Sam Alman that just said, you know, every company is turning into an API company. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that&#39;s interesting because interfaces are in a sense dying in that way of like you know you won&#39;t interact like the ultimate interface for whatever reason seems to be chat and text message and it&#39;s happened twice now of like okay the chat GPT moment was a chat box and now it&#39;s the openclaw moment which is like a text message or telegram so it&#39;s
(42:25) like okay chat has happened twice um and that just means okay so we just want to wait for our agent to be able to use all the tools that we use and we don&#39;t really care about how it does it. It just needs to be able to do it and and it runs in in the background um and does it under the hood. Um so here, okay, I started uh I built you can see that this agent in the playground built out the Tik Tok agent.
(42:52) py inside the computer. So now I asked OpenClaw, hey um I built a Tik Tok agent.py in your desktop. Can you take a look? And it&#39;s re it says, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve read it. Here&#39;s what I see. Uh there&#39;s a skeleton for, you know, using Orgo um plus uh Anthropics API.&quot; Go ahead, Greg. &gt;&gt; No, you keep going.
(43:16) &gt;&gt; And and it was and it was um you know, all all the actual Tik Tok logic, uh trend detection, all this stuff. Um it&#39;s like, okay, maybe we should build that out. &gt;&gt; And it&#39;s like, oh, you got the API keys hardcoded, etc., etc. So, let&#39;s just say Let&#39;s use this script build on top of it or whatever you need to do and let&#39;s spin up a orgo VM inside of the Greg Eisenberg workspace to accomplish this um automation with Tik Tok.
(43:54) Let&#39;s demo it just working. We can spawn a uh sub aent and VM in this workspace. And let me just give it a API key just in case it needs that. What really blows my mind about this whole thing is that, you know, I was going to say we we&#39;re we&#39;re building a business in a very short amount of time, but it&#39;s really like we&#39;re building an asset.
(44:25)  like the amount of assets that people are going to be be building um using tools like this is is going to be crazy, right? &gt;&gt; It&#39;s insane. Honestly, it comes down to like honestly like it comes down to taste now. Good ideas. Um cuz like if you have a good idea, it could just build it and yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s going to be like oh my goodness what&#39;s going to happen with all of these assets like you said that people are just going to build and build and build.
(44:58) There&#39;s going to be so many assets. I think is this what is this what we mean when we talk about the um the abundance that AI will bring you know of solving all these problems? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I think what ends up happening is, you know, unfortunately, there are going to be more and more layoffs as AI helps with productivity.
(45:22)  At the same time, I think there&#39;s going to be a renaissance, the golden age of entrepreneurship and people creating assets, products like this, oneperson businesses, and uh that&#39;s how I see it playing out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. even even maybe may we don&#39;t know officially but maybe it&#39;s already happened with Peter Steinberger the creator of openclaw you know he he just um officially announced he&#39;s joining open AAI &gt;&gt; like I think it was just him who built Open Claw how much did he get you know aqua hired for I think it was a lot
(45:59) &gt;&gt; um &gt;&gt; so that&#39;s that&#39;s I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s cool I think this is the best time to be a builder tinkerer to get creative Um, I I&#39;m excited to see what people build with Open Claw and computer use agents in general of like there&#39;s so many things, you know, whether it&#39;s a a super fast chess computer use agent or if it&#39;s something that&#39;s genuinely driving an outcome in your business.
(46:27)  Like I just think there&#39;s so many things that can be built. Um, playing around with these tools, getting familiar, learning how to how to leverage them. Yes, AI is going to be replacing a lot of jobs, but also it&#39;s going to enable a lot of people to do things, you know, that they&#39;ve never been able to build before, and now they can do it.
(46:47)  So, um, yeah, I&#39;m I&#39;m just Oh, here it is. Okay, so you can see &gt;&gt; it spun up this computer, Tik Tok Trend Hunter, and my screen&#39;s just refreshing. Uh, let me just click into it and and I could just tab back and forth a little bit to see. Okay, VM is up. It&#39;s opening Firefox. Let me wait for the agent loop to start. Here we go.
(47:09)  So, it&#39;s spun up its own computer. This is insane, Greg. It&#39;s spun up its own computer. OpenClaw did. And now it&#39;s it&#39;s using its own Python script that it just made just now. We took it from idea browser. And now it&#39;s going to go do this thing. um that we just built out. I don&#39;t know how long this took.
(47:30)  Last like 10 minutes kind of just, you know, in between we&#39;re talking, having our coffee. It&#39;s like this is insane. I don&#39;t know. It kind of It makes me It gets me giddy. It&#39;s like uh and it&#39;s going to figure this out. It&#39;s like, you know, it&#39;s going to debug like, okay, what&#39;s going on? Why am I on the ads.tiktock.
(47:50) com? Let me reroute myself. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to figure all this out. Uh, but it&#39;s just cooking, you know. &gt;&gt; Crazy, dude. Crazy. Anything else you want to cover before we head out? Yeah, I think um as far as other things to cover, I mean I I just want people to start thinking about these tools, you know, yes, they&#39;re they&#39;re once again they&#39;re great personal assistance, but if you start thinking of OpenClaw as an NAN or you start thinking of it as um you know, like a Lindy AI of like you know people
(48:28) there are real businesses right now like we can go to Upwork right now and find jobs that are being posted around, you know, things like this. This is what you do. You just go to Upwork. Upwork&#39;s great because you get to see what the market&#39;s asking for and you just type in uh robotic process automation.
(48:47)  you know, this old outdated way of of programmatically automating tasks that is like clunky and it breaks and it&#39;s not intelligent. If the button isn&#39;t in the exact UI space that you just delegated it to, it won&#39;t work. And you go here, look, posted yesterday, Android RPA automation posted yesterday, automation pipeline for client upload.
(49:12) You go here. You could just do let&#39;s let&#39;s find $500, $1,000, $5,000. Let&#39;s look at all these projects. Okay, this one. Boom. Right here. Um $1,000 budget. I&#39;m looking for experienced automation engineer to build desktop automation computer use uh for my software business.
(49:34)  We sell a specialized dynamic PDF. You take all this context, give it to open cloud, give it to Claude code. How much of it can you build out as a demo based off of this context alone? Send a proposal. You have your first customer right here, $1,000. Um, get get some case studies, leverage that. Maybe go deeper into this industry that this person&#39;s in.
(49:56)  Start building out specialized workflows using cloudbot open claw for all the different vertical use cases in that. Create a workspace of it. Um, I think that&#39;s where we&#39;re at right now and I&#39;m excited by this. So, um, yeah, I I guess we&#39;ll just see where it goes. And yeah, okay, this needs a little debugging as to be expected.
(50:14)  We spent 10 minutes on it, but I think you get the gist. Um, and yeah, I&#39;m excited to see what everyone builds. &gt;&gt; From your lips to God&#39;s ears, baby. I I&#39;m I think your approach makes complete sense. Um, it&#39;s the exact approach I would use. Totally recommend it. people, get your hands dirty, get tinkering.
(50:37)  I&#39;m excited for what you build. Um, Nick doesn&#39;t do a lot of podcasts. Um, I think I was only able to find him do one live stream before. So, show him some love in the comment section. Uh, like the video. Um, show him some love and, um, Nick, I hope you come back on. Uh, share more use cases.
(51:00)  I&#39;m going to be sharing more use cases that I&#39;m using that my you know I haven&#39;t done uh too many publicly but I&#39;m going to be sharing more of my use cases both on virtual machines and on my own Mac Mini uh for my open claw stuff. So get ready for that folks. And uh Nick wait is there anything is there is there anything else before before we go that you want that you want to share? I just want to share with you, Greg.
(51:26)  You don&#39;t know this, but I&#39;ve been a longtime follower. &gt;&gt; This is my YouTube Rewind 2025 top.5%. So, if you&#39;re watching this and you love Greg&#39;s podcast, you love his videos, you you get building on top of it, you put cool stuff out there, you know, you join your you join your top YouTube channel on your on your re your rewind of the year.
(51:51) &gt;&gt; I love it. I love it. Nick, you&#39;re a legend. You got to come back on. You&#39;re one of us. You&#39;re one of us. So, uh, appreciate I appreciate that. Thank you, Greg. Thank you for having me.
