Transcript:
(00:01) My name is Johan Sati Nathan. I&#39;ve made over six figures of revenue with Cloud Code. I built and sold my first startup in under 12 months. And I&#39;m in the process of exiting my second startup, which also took under 12 months for my idea to exit. And so I gave a talk at an official anthropic event about a month ago on how to make money with Cloud Code. Full breakdown.
(00:18)  You can check out my website yoh.fyi/dnx to get these full slides on how you can make money with cloud code. But the recent update is OpenClaw, formerly Maltbot, formerly Claudebot. It is the AI that actually does things. I&#39;ve been playing around with it for the last week and I found some amazing use cases for how you can actually make money with it.
(00:32) So, I want to share those all with you today for free. So, let&#39;s jump straight into it. First of all, these entire slides that I made, I told my open call assistant to make these slides for me based off the things that I&#39;ve been using it for. That way, it&#39;s true things that I&#39;ve been using it for.
(00:46)  It made these slides and I&#39;m ready to share everything that I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been doing with it. So, quick little rundown of OpenClaw. It runs 24/7 on your machine connected to Telegram or WhatsApp. People have been buying Mac minis for them. You can also deploy it to Hexner or any other cloud server. That way you can access it wherever you want from your phone. There&#39;s grock.com.
(01:04) If you sign up for this, you can send voice messages to OpenClaw 100% fle 100% free without using OpenAI API, which is pretty cool. But how can you turn OpenClaw into your AI employee? Because that is the biggest thing that I&#39;ve been obsessed with this this last week. And the biggest way that I see is that OpenClaw is not your AI employee, but it&#39;s your AI orchestrator and it has a full team under it with sub agents.
(01:25)  So spin up specialized workers for any tasks and I want to give you an example of this is that I have had an old agency site jar solutions right here and I also started a school community recently and yesterday I told my open claw assistant I have two websites that I need you to work on spin up sub aents for them and then that way it can work on parallel at the exact same time and I can still talk to my main assistants and it made this site in 5 minutes deployed it to verscell aioperator.sh SH.
(01:51)  You can check it out. And it also went ahead and updated my old site. And both of these sites, it was working in parallel. It took under 10 minutes to update them. And this can go for as far as you can imagine. If you have any complicated task that is not chatbased. So if you are talking to your bot and you do not expect an immediate answer, you are telling it to go out and do something, always say spin up a sub agent for this.
(02:09) That way you can still talk to your main bot and you can have tons of bots in parallel. That way you can have tons of specialized tasks working in parallel and you can still talk to your main bot. That&#39;s all you need to remember. Spin up a sub agent. Phone jobs automate recurring tasks on a schedule.
(02:22)  This is where people are saying it&#39;s AGI, but it&#39;s not AGI. It&#39;s prompt driven behavior. And I&#39;m going to show you my bot right here. It&#39;s running in Telegram. And every single day, there&#39;s nine automated jobs that are Chrome jobs. So, it sends me a morning briefing every day.
(02:34)  I give it readonly access to tons of my different data, my email, my Stripe. So, my analytics. That way, every single morning, I&#39;m getting a nice briefing to understand how my business performed overnight, how it performed the last day, what do I need to focus on? And it runs every single day. And then CRM review every single day.
(02:48)  At night, I use my AI assistant as a CRM. I&#39;ve connected it readonly access to Fathom, which is a meeting recording, and it is able to understand all these meetings that I do, all these demo calls I do with potential customers for DMRO. By the way, the tool that I&#39;m working on is DMOR.ai.
(03:04)  It&#39;s a Twitter cold DM automation tool. And I&#39;m using my AA assistant very heavily to grow it and make money. And these are the use cases that I&#39;m sharing with you guys, but it can be switched to any business you&#39;re working on. So, the CRM review, every single day, it updates me on my CRM. Who did I follow up with? who do I need to follow up with? Because it has read only access to my business email.
(03:21)  So, it can check if I followed up with people, if I need to nag them, whatever it is to help get people who are in the pipeline, the warm leads to end up subscribing. And then three times a day or four times a day, it nags me to post content, right? So, 3 p.m. we&#39;re going to get another notification in 10 minutes saying, &quot;Did you post content yet? Did you post content yet?&quot; Because I want to share more stuff.
(03:39)  I know that I&#39;m building cool stuff and I just want to share it with people. Maybe I&#39;m able to help some people, whatever it might be. And then also, I can get feedback on what I&#39;m building, right? cuz I think that I&#39;m doing some nice stuff, but I know that there&#39;s people who are building a lot of crazier use cases.
(03:50)  So, I want to hear them. That way, we can sort of just bounce ideas back and forth and continuously improve. So, it has four content pools and then overnight build. Every single day at 2 a.m., it built something to help my business. And yesterday night, it built some AI tools or it built some SEO pages for DMRO. So, if we come over to DMRO, it was building tons of free tools. So, all free tools.
(04:11) It built some free tools for me. Outreach ROI Planner. And as you can see here, these are all automated. Every single night, it&#39;ll build a new free tool. It&#39;ll also do these for my other SAS products that I have or potentially AI operators. It&#39;ll add some comparison pages to help us get organic traffic, which is very cool.
(04:27)  And then GitHub backup. Every 2 hours, my entire AI bot is backed up to GitHub, its brain, its memory, everything. That way, if anything ever happens to it, I do not lose my baby. I do not lose my AI assistant, which is very nice. And then calorie tracker. Daily at 8 p.m. I&#39;m trying to get to 75 kilos.
(04:44)  So, it&#39;s helping me track that. Make sure that I intake 4,000 calories every single day. Um, and then memory. Your bot remembers everything. It&#39;s not like clock. It&#39;s not like chatbt. So, this is very good to help you actually grow your business. You can tell it everything. Especially if you set up Grock for voice messages, you can just talk to it about what&#39;s going on in your business.
(04:59)  What do you need to fix? It&#39;ll help you. It&#39;ll remember and in the future when you bring it up, it&#39;s not going to forget it. That&#39;s the whole point of memory. Automate your revenue machine. So, self-updating CRM updates itself from call transcripts automatically. Like I said, I have Fathom right here.
(05:12)  I invite it to calls. It has readonly access. My bot has read only access to Fathom so that I can check what the status is from people who got on demo calls with me. Did they say yes, I&#39;m going to book? Did I offer them a coupon? If I offer them a coupon, I need to make sure I send them a coupon.
(05:26)  It can automatically update the CRM, which is very good. And then if someone says they&#39;re going to subscribe, they don&#39;t end up subscribing. A week later, it will remind me saying, &quot;Hey, this person said they were going to subscribe. You got hopped on a call with them.&quot; Make sure you push them. Subscribe. Daily pip pipeline review.
(05:37) Like I said, I have a crown job going off every single day at 9:00 p.m. where it sends me an update on everything for my pipeline, all the warm leads. That way, I can make sure to push whoever I need to push. Bulk personalized outreach. Every single night, my AI bot is finding 50 different agencies that could be potential customers for DM Pro and it is drafting up personalized outreach messages.
(05:56)  It scans people&#39;s LinkedIn. It verifies their emails with Apollo IO API and make sure that these quality emails are going out. And then leadfinder scans Reddit, Indie hackers, Twitter for more leads. It also did this last night, which is very cool. It&#39;s blowing my mind that it could do this because these are things that you would have to hire virtual assistants for before.
(06:13) SEO and content on autopilot. I talked about this a little bit. The content mag system. So, this is where every single day I&#39;m getting four different Chrome jobs reminding me to post content, reminding me, reminding me, reminding me. This is why I&#39;m making this video because it drafted up the full script for this video.
(06:27)  It made this entire presentation. It was like these these are things you&#39;re already doing. Just open the presentation, talk about the stuff you&#39;re doing. that pushed me to make this video, but every single night is making free tools and PSO pages and that that I think it&#39;s pretty self-explanatory.
(06:41)  If you have more pages going out, more high quality content going out, you&#39;re going to get organic traffic. And this is doing it entirely on autopilot, which is very nice. Build and deploy while you sleep. So, every single night before I sleep, I ask my bot, what are you going to do? What are you going to do for the night? How are you going to help me grow my business? And every single night, five to 10 sub agents are working.
(06:58)  Last night, I had 21 different sub agents working overnight. I had a product hunt, directory submission going up. I had tons of PSO pages, free tools for DMRO. It was reaching out to potential agency clients for DMRO and all these things while I was sleeping. Very, very amazing. I&#39;m very excited. I wish I could explain it a lot more.
(07:15)  So, yeah, that was a little rundown of like what my OpenClaw bot is doing and how you can make money with it. If you want to check it out, yo.fy/openclaw. I didn&#39;t prepare for this video at all. I just had my bot make this and I wanted to talk just raw about what I&#39;m doing, how I&#39;m making money with this. Hopefully this helped you, but feel free to leave a comment below and I&#39;m happy to answer any questions because I&#39;m sure there&#39;s definitely some stuff that I skipped or stuff that I went over too fast. Feel free to check it out on my
(07:39) website. I&#39;m happy to share and answer any questions. I have a link below for a school community where I&#39;m doing weekly calls and just sharing all the prompts. I have my AI bot regularly updating the content in there based off the stuff that I&#39;m actually doing. That way it&#39;s real actionable insights on the things that I&#39;m daily doing.
(07:55)  Also, you can check out dmpro.ai to automate Twitter cold DMs. The link in the bio. I want to do more yapping videos where I just talk and see how that goes. So, thanks. Keep building. Keep shipping. I move.
