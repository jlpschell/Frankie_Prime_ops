Transcript:
(00:00) Today&#39;s video we&#39;ll be going through five dangerous skills that you could start using and installing onto your OpenClaw. Doesn&#39;t matter if you run it on a VPS or if you&#39;re doing it on like a, you know, Mac Mini. Just wanted to preface this video by saying that before you install anything onto your OpenClaw, you want to make sure that when you do go on platforms like Clawhub and start downloading skills onto your OpenClaw, you want to make sure you check the documentation to make sure there isn&#39;t
(00:25) any malicious software because a study found that 7.1% of all skills that you&#39;re downloading online contain malicious software. You don&#39;t want that being leaked to the public and you don&#39;t want people having access to your Mac or to your VPS. All right. So, before we do that, the best way to download skills and to have your OpenClaw learn skills is to manually type it in into your Telegram chat with OpenClaw just like I am, you know.
(00:51)  So, I&#39;m giving it instructions here. So, for my business, I send cold emails to business owners. I do B2B business. I sell them a service. I pretty much tell OpenClaw exactly what I wanted to do in terms of pulling data and being able to track my daily campaigns, seeing how many emails were sent today, how many of them were positive replies, how many of them were negative replies, how many sales calls were booked.
(01:12)  And pretty much every morning, OpenClaw will send me a report um going through exactly what happened that day. And since we&#39;re not sending any emails on Monday to Friday, I pretty much tell OpenClaw only send this update on Monday to Friday. And then I tell OpenClaw to then create this into a skill.
(01:29)  So this is just a specific use case of how I&#39;m doing it for my own business. But let&#39;s go into the five dangerous skills that you can start teaching your OpenClaw to do right now. So the first dangerous skill that you can teach OpenClaw to do is browser control. For my business, I actually need to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to scrape leads and to find these business owners emails.
(01:49)  So OpenClaw can actually just head into your browser. Whether you use Google Chrome or Safari, you can give it browser access or it could use its own native browser called Chromium to log on to LinkedIn Sales Navigator and then perform a search or a scrape to then find you those emails. So I don&#39;t have to manually go do that every single day.
(02:08)  The only negative side of this is that a lot of these platforms, they actually have bot detection. So that&#39;s why you want to give uh OpenClaw a browser access or desktop access so it can literally just perform that task as if you were at the desk yourself rather than using a bot to do that. And uh that&#39;s why a lot of people have been getting banned um or being disabled from these platforms because you know these platforms have these anti-bot detection tools so that they can sense whether or not you&#39;re using a bot. So make sure if
(02:34) you&#39;re using OpenCloud to do this and you&#39;re using a bot to do this, make sure to give it the command that to only log into this platform maybe twice a day and nothing more than that. Another very dangerous use case of this is to you know monitor your competitors. Getting openclaw and typing in the chat literally to openclaw telling them hey spy on this competitor website and make sure you know when their prices increase or when their prices decrease that you know change our own price as well to match theirs because I don&#39;t really see
(02:59) nn or make.com and other automation tools being able to do this and judge based on this. Um you probably could set it up but it&#39;s just probably a little harder rather than sending a text message to your telegram bot. Um, but the third thing is automated job applications. So if you&#39;re a freelancer, if you&#39;re working right now and you&#39;re looking for work, rather than setting up an automation on nadn or make.
(03:19) com to track, you know, new postings or stuff like that, and I know, you know, Upwork and Fiverr to give you like notifications of new work postings, you can&#39;t really automate the application process through any end. So this is a very strong use case of OpenClaw where it&#39;s able to actually just go on your browser, hop onto Upwork, hop onto, you know, these job postings like Indeed and then start applying uh for these jobs based off the information that you give it.
(03:43)  So it&#39;s important when you first start off that you do give it your background information and who you are, how much experience you have, your portfolio. So then it&#39;s able to best apply for these jobs. And open clause is great in the sense that it&#39;s also able to, you know, fill out forms online for you like tax.
(03:56)  No one wants to be do tax stuff and you know accounting stuff, compliance filings and business registrations. It&#39;s able to apply for those for you. And later on in this video, we&#39;ll be talking about another use case where it&#39;s also able to make phone calls on your behalf. And just make sure you know another security uh measure that you should have in mind is that you know once you give openclaw access to your browser or its own browser chromium uh that you do create you know a separate Gmail account and a separate user account let&#39;s say uh maybe
(04:23) a user on your Mac and just don&#39;t give it access to your main Gmail account and your Google Drive folders. U make sure it&#39;s completely separate just to keep things clean. want to also make a security video if you&#39;re wanting to see that next so that you can best protect yourself from malware and from people breaching your data.
(04:40)  So yeah, you want to make a dedicated Chrome profile with LinkedIn speed limits. So all you have to do is just type it down in the Telegram chat right below here. And you want to also make sure you run all your browser automation in Docker containers. And if you&#39;re running cold outreach just like me or if you&#39;re running a business and uh if you&#39;re using an application or a software which can detect bots then make sure you paste in this code similar to this into your telegram bot.
(05:03)  You can just copy and paste this and just put this into claude or um chat GPT and make sure that it just fits your software that you&#39;re using if they or should they detect bots um on their platform. So like I said before, a very interesting use case of using openclaw is by using it to make voice calls and phone automation via integration with 11 labs.
(05:22) So I also have an 11 labs uh subscription right now where it&#39;s able to you know where you record your voice for let&#39;s say 3 to 6 minutes and it&#39;s able to replicate your voice. So then it speaks and it sounds exactly like you and also link it to retail or synlow AI. These are a few use cases that we&#39;re using as well.
(05:39)  And we&#39;re also selling these as a service to the businesses and local businesses down the street like service- based businesses like you know HVAC businesses, lawn remodeling, pest control because a lot of these guys they&#39;re too focused on actually doing the work and out in the field doing their work and they&#39;re not having the time to pick up the phone.
(05:57)  So then AI can actually do this for them. But other than that, it&#39;s just a very interesting use case and powerful use case you could use because it could literally make restaurant bookings for you. You can schedule appointments just like calling your doctor, your dentist, your barber, your mechanic to book the next available spot and it gives you a confirmation on telegram or email when that slot was booked.
(06:16)  One issue with this particular use case is that it&#39;s actually not legal to do this um I think in California or in some states. Um and the FTC actually issued a $5.1 million fine for AI voice calls in 2024. Um, so what you want to do, uh, if you&#39;re using this for business purposes or you&#39;re using this in a different context to personal, you want to make sure that at the beginning of the phone call, you put in the prompt saying that, you know, this is an AI, then lead with the phone call after that, just to make sure you&#39;re
(06:41) protecting yourself. If you&#39;re using this on a corporate or a business level, then you want to make sure you&#39;re protecting yourself as well. And I recommend you also starting low stakes at first. So maybe just start off using it for maybe restaurants and maybe doing appointments first, not, you know, not lead calls or not client calls.
(06:56)  and you want to make sure it records everything. So then you want to make sure the AI isn&#39;t saying anything wrong or giving any false data, you know, manipulating any data you have given it. To set this all up, it usually costs around $5 to $22 a month for 11 labs and calling their APIs.
(07:10)  For a phone line, it&#39;s extremely cheap, probably $1 per phone line, and it&#39;s a couple cents per minute of phone call. So it&#39;s very easy to set up and very easy to to get going on a monthly basis. It&#39;s only like a few cents per minute. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re making a few calls per month or a few calls per week.
(07:24)  It&#39;s only going to be like a dollar a month. And with integration, I would use GoHigh Level for this. And it&#39;s probably like a $97 a month to host guy go high level just to make sure that it&#39;s tracking everything. But if you&#39;re not operating a business to do this, you don&#39;t really need a CRM to start this.
(07:39)  11 Labs and Retail and Synflow, they already have automatic recording. So it will record your conversations and you can then ask OpenCloud to analyze those conversations and then build on how to improve those conversations in the future. The next extremely powerful skill that you should use is called an exec and shell command. So this is extremely powerful and also extremely dangerous.
(07:56)  I recommend you proceed with caution here. But for those who don&#39;t know what an exec and shell command is. Let&#39;s take a restaurant for example. So you walk into a restaurant. You have to interact with the waiter. You have to interact with the menu. You have to kind of like look at the menu and order through the waiter.
(08:10)  But an exec and shell command is pretty much you pretty much going into the kitchen and ordering whatever you want. So for a computer to to click on a browser and to know you know Google go on Google Chrome and to you know go on google.com you have to you know click a few buttons and then type in the google.
(08:25) com onto the browser. But by running an exec and shell command on your terminal it literally bypasses all of that and it&#39;s the most rawest form of communication with your computer. And the dangerous part of this is that an exec and shell command will never ask you are you sure you want to do this? You know it just executes. It doesn&#39;t have a question.
(08:42) And that&#39;s why you know these windows and these buttons and these pretty things are exist on your computer is because it&#39;s easier for you to interact and give your computer commands. But if you&#39;re just running commands on the rawest purest form is through an exec and shell command.
(08:56)  Why this is so powerful is because you can literally while you&#39;re at a coffee shop on a Sunday, you know, having some coffee and reading a book, you can literally just tell Telegram to build me a website or to write me a video script, literally just sit there and when you get home, it&#39;s already done and you can just iterate on that rather than having to go home, you know, research on how to build a website and then build it yourself, right? Apps are literally being built while you&#39;re not even at the computer or
(09:18) you can also manage servers and ask, you know, OpenClaw to run a cron. So every, you know, 30 minutes, you know, per heartbeat, maybe like every 30 minutes or per hour, it kind of scans your server and scans your website. And just like the recent Super Bowl ad on AI.com, you know, they ran the ad for a couple million dollars at the Super Bowl and their website was down.
(09:37)  So a very powerful use case of this is to have OpenClaw check for your website status every 30 minutes or every hour if you&#39;re having a lot of customers visit on it every single day because an hour where it&#39;s down is a lot of money lost on the business&#39;s end. You know this particular skill is extremely dangerous as well because any command if you type in a command like rmrf slash it deletes your home directory.
(10:00)  If you download a random skill on let&#39;s say clawhub.com without doing much documentation research some malware could be downloaded onto your computer and it could access you know shell and x command without you knowing. So so I highly recommend you take caution when you&#39;re using this step because it&#39;s extremely powerful.
(10:14)  So the more powerful the tool is usually the more the higher the risk level. So I I recommend you start small, require manual approval before deleting, install or system modifying any commands and make sure you restrict the command to open claw workspace only, not to your entire system.
(10:30)  And again, that&#39;s why I recommend running this on a separate computer or on a VPS completely separate from your main workspace. So another very powerful skill that you could use is called screen control and desktop automation. So this is different from browser control, right? browser is like going on Safari, Mozilla, Firefox, Chrome, Arc, but this is your entire desktop, right? So, it has access to all your applications, any window, any software that you have on your computer at the moment.
(10:57)  It moves a mouse just like a regular human does. It types and navigates any interface exactly like how a human is sitting at your desk, right? You want to treat OpenClaw just like an employee, right? Or just like a person, right? You give it a desk, you give it a computer, and it operates, right? So if you&#39;re managing or using any fancy software, you can literally give it screen control where it records your screen and it literally sees you operating the software.
(11:19)  You can then transfer that and tell OpenClaw to convert that into a skill. So then it can operate the software and do the work while you&#39;re not there. This is a super powerful skill to to have. But again, also that has an equal downside of risk because it does have access to your screen.
(11:37)  Everything is recorded on your screen. So it can see what you&#39;re doing. it can see your email banking information. So if something comes up where you actually accidentally download a malicious software on claw hub, it can actually breach your server. So overarching theme is that you want to build the skills yourself. You want to tell openclaw, here&#39;s what I want you to do. Here&#39;s what to do.
(11:55)  Now transfer and convert that into a skill rather than downloading random skills on the internet. And this is also good practice, right? You also know exactly how it operates and how it responds to how you talk to it. So the last really important skill that you should use that&#39;s quite dangerous as well is to transform your open claw into a memory keeper.
(12:12)  So let&#39;s say you&#39;re hopping on a call with a prospect or with a client and it tells and the prospect tells you hey like I&#39;m actually having a baby in 2 months. Open claw can literally remember that and it can have access to your recording like Fathom or Zoom and after 3 months after your prospect had the baby it can literally send them a message saying congratulations um you know are we still on for the deal? it it&#39;s able to maintain that human touch at scale and which is why this is so dangerous and so powerful but at the same time you know you do have your
(12:39) client&#39;s information on your database. So if there is a leak um you know that&#39;s going to be leaked out and you know you&#39;re probably going to get sued for that. So what you want to do is you want to separate your business from personal data. You want to have clear categories so the client personal data is isolated from general business data.
(12:56)  And for every single month you want to perform an openclaw memory audit where it reviews deleted, outdated, incorrect or sensitive content. So since OpenClaw does have the power of memory um over months it learns your writing style, your pricing strategy, how you perform on sales calls. So the longer you operate under OpenClaw&#39;s supervision, the better it gets.
(13:16)  So this is the prompt you should use for your open claw in your terminal if you want to have your memory segmented so it better classifies and stores your memory properly. So I feel like everyone using openclaw should be knowing this. Don&#39;t download skills online without reading the documentation. This is the exact step by step on how I create a skill by communicating that with my telegram bot.
(13:35) You want to tell it in plain English what you want it to do. So in my case, I want to go to LinkedIn Sales Navigator to scrape the leads and to find my ideal ICP and client base. And then I ask OpenCloud to save it as a skill. And then step three, every time you reference that skill, it will then run that skill.
(13:53)  All right, so these are the skills that you could build yourself. And of course, you don&#39;t just want to copy and paste this. This is just a general outline of what you know the skills generally entail, but you want to, you know, customize this to your own use case and to your own daily life. you you have different use cases, but these are just the five really powerful skills you should use and the risks that comes with it.
