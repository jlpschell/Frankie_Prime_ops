Transcript:
(00:01) Okay, so this video it I I&#39;ve been trying to get uh Kimmy&#39;s memory to be like um consistent, right? Like you know Jarvis like because whenever it would do like memory compaction whenever I would continue the conversation, she&#39;d be like, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; or &quot;Is this what you mean?&quot; Some weird stuff, you know? So, I got to thinking and I I wanted to do this like before there was OpenClaw.
(00:32)  I tried to build this in NAD, right? I mean, I got it kind of working, but with OpenClaw, there&#39;s a lot more things that I don&#39;t have to do that are like handled. So, so I basically added uh Reddus database and and um Quadrant database. So that um so I have Quadrant and Reddus. And so with K with So I&#39;m going to say Kimmy.
(01:03)  I know it&#39;s not a her, it&#39;s an it. And I feel obligated to say that every time because I&#39;m going to call it her for probably this entire video. Anyways, so Reddus is, you know, a in-memory database and it&#39;s just like uh a typical database. Uh and then Quadrant is the vector database, you know, that works really well with LLMs because it can tie things together that are related with a percentage, right? Like the the vector ties and stuff like that.
(01:34)  So what I did was well really what Kimmy did was I told her I said okay with Reddus I so I first was like probing about okay what happens to your memory what happens when it&#39;s compacted what happens this how do you get your memories how do you you know and and basically what I understood was and again I I do feel like I should say okay this is what I did to get this working it might not be the best way it might not be I&#39;m It&#39;s very surely not the only way, but um it it actually is working really nice. Okay. And I&#39;ll
(02:09) explain a little more detail as we go. And then really at the end, I have some other things that I&#39;m working on that are just they&#39;re really freaking awesome or at least they are to me. So anyways, so Reddus is real fast like memory uh style database. So it stores things, but if you if you turn the power off, you lose it.
(02:32)  So whenever I built these two things, Reddus is like short-term memory and Quadrant is like long-term memory. So Quadrant just continues to get all the conversations, but but I&#39;m getting out of order. Okay, so first I&#39;m going to describe Reddus. Okay, so with Kimmy, I have you have the heartbeat, right? So the heartbeat is uh it&#39;s every 30 minutes.
(02:54)  I had her change hers to like every hour. So Kimmy&#39;s heartbeat does two things, right? So it it one thing it does is it takes every heartbeat it takes the entire context like every word and puts it into Reddus. Okay. So every time the heartbeat goes is once an hour it grabs every single word of our conversations and puts it into Reddus.
(03:21)  So if there&#39;s a memory compaction, well there is a one area that it could miss, but I&#39;m gonna kind of cover that in a second. But so every word from our conversation goes into Reddus every heartbeat. Okay? And so that&#39;s short-term memory. So if I need her to recall something, she can go and get it from like our conversation.
(03:42)  Okay? Like our full conversation, not not compaction when it happens. It&#39;s meant to clear context for the LLM so that it doesn&#39;t like get too full and it starts hallucinating and getting all jacked up. It&#39;s kind of like a recover memory. But what it does is it it builds a summary of your past conversations.
(04:01)  So depending on how well the summary is done, you know, you lose a lot of context. And one of the things I was thinking is long-term memory. I don&#39;t want a summary in long-term memory. I want like I want AI dictated facts and details, right? like in in the long-term memory. So every heartbeat the entire conversation and and it also checks for duplicates so it won&#39;t like duplicate well I&#39;m sorry it checks for duplicates when it puts it into quadrant but it takes the entire conversation and puts it in Reddus every
(04:31) heartbeat. So, at 3:30 a.m. or 3:00 a.m., it the um uh cron job runs and takes everything in Reddus and puts it into quadrant smartly, right? I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a word, but in a smart way, it builds the quadrant database. So, it basically in the way I&#39;m thinking of it is it converts short-term memory to long-term memory.
(04:58)  Right? So then it once that&#39;s successful it erases Reddus and so our next conversations will start storing in Reddus again. um this this goes in parallel with the standard open claw um filing or memory system right so all the MD files all that stuff that all is just I didn&#39;t want to interrupt that process I wanted to improve upon it but still keep that core functionality right so so that&#39;s how it works right and so um so I was I I got I got Kimmy to like add to the website right so this is what&#39;s really cool right So,
(05:39) I had her go to the website and add these different um these different things. So, basically, if you go down to tutorials, she created these three different things or tutorials. So, she created, okay, this is the video Jarvis like memory for Kimmy. Um and it and it has a like a tutorial, but it&#39;s not the actual tutorial.
(06:03)  Um she also created memory architecture and then a memory comparison like a side by side. Now I did ask for these specifically but one thing that I asked for also was I said okay if someone wants to recreate what we did okay so I&#39;ve got this working pretty well and it&#39;s very nice. Okay it&#39;s like it really is like freaking Jarvis.
(06:28)  Um but I was like if someone wants to do it how can you how can I give them something? So, so in downloads, she put together this memory blueprint. So, this not only com has the um has the uh the way that it&#39;s designed, but also she created all the Python scripts to do all the different functions, right, to work with Quadrant, to work with Reddus, things to that the heartbeat does.
(06:55)  Like I mean I think that your AI could probably do them, but this is actually a download of all the different Python scripts. 30 plus. I don&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t just put an exact number. Seems kind of odd. But all the freaking Python scripts that she uses to manage and to to have this memory function properly.
(07:16)  But and then here&#39;s something cool too, right? So um so where was it? Um so in tutorials okay so you can come look at we&#39;ll we&#39;ll just look at each one so here&#39;s the tutorial the Jarvis like memory what you will build uh reddus buffer markdown logs quadrant ve oh also it it it has a backup right so the at 3:00 it it converts everything from reddus into quadrant vector database okay and then at 3:30 it goes through her built-in logs and puts that into quadrant So, basically, if Reddit missed something for whatever reason,
(07:53) let&#39;s say I rebooted or or it rebooted for some reason, there&#39;s still the actual M uh MD files, markdown files that that are still there because it&#39;s still functioning as it was designed. So, at 3:30, there&#39;s a cron job to put it in quadrant because think of quadrant like the the actual brain.
(08:15)  It&#39;s like the long-term memory. And so all these different things that I do, they get stored in quadrant and she can I just say, &quot;Hey, do you remember this?&quot; And she&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, so this is it&#39;s going to get better. So just just bear with me, okay? So here&#39;s like the stepby-step uh instructions, right? Um I mean, if you have Open Claw, you could probably just say here&#39;s this here&#39;s what here&#39;s what I want you to do and copy and paste that in there or whatever.
(08:41) &quot; So that was the um that and then here&#39;s the memory architecture, right? So um I&#39;m not sure how accurate this is. It seemed pretty good. Um one thing to note in Quadrant, it&#39;s under my ID. So my name is the ID. That way all the memories that are related to me are under my ID. Um the first time I was trying it before in one of the other videos in a similar way, um it was stored wrong. Okay.
(09:11)  So, this this way is the right way. Um, so here&#39;s uh this this is stuff she put together. Your chat message saved to Reddus. Today&#39;s MD FI and today&#39;s MD file. Heartbeat every 30 to 60 minutes. New turns. And it&#39;s new turns is something that she&#39;s been saying, but I guess it&#39;s like the files being done.
(09:33)  Like I don&#39;t that&#39;s just what she&#39;s been calling it and I didn&#39;t change it. Um, so then you ask remember X and searches Quadrant returns relevant past conversation. So it&#39;s like it&#39;s less context, right? Um, whenever it pulls the stuff from Quadrant because it&#39;s uh, you know, it pulls like the highest related things.
(09:51) Now this is the best thing, right? Now this is freaking awesome. So compare memory comparison systems. So So she put it she made a comparison. I asked her to do a sidebyside. So here&#39;s OpenClaw default and here&#39;s like the MD files. Um, anyways, it saves it like that and and I don&#39;t think this is actually like the full detail.
(10:11)  I think it could be improved. But then here&#39;s the session live reddis buffer daily files MD. So this is the built-in and then both of these get this one happens at at three this goes to quadrant and then at 3:30 her files that were logged go to quadrant. So quadrant and it&#39;s and it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t allow duplicates uh on a hash.
(10:34)  So it it keeps like duplicate values out so that you don&#39;t have a mess. Um user sends a message. Now now this is the part that&#39;s freaking awesome. Okay, quick comparison blah blah blah checks and you can go to my website and check this out. Okay, so this is this is some she suggested like I said I wanted to do some examples.
(10:52)  She said can is do you think we could use like real example examples of our conversations together? And I&#39;m like yeah that&#39;s fine. I was like that&#39;s actually pretty cool. So here&#39;s like this is me actually. I said this and this is what she said, but this is how she retrieved it.
(11:10)  This wasn&#39;t known to me at the time. I just it just happened like in the back seamlessly, right? So she said, and I&#39;m not going to go through every one, but Deb 2 is the is the uh that&#39;s the uh SSH Debian machine that she has access to where she built my website and everything. So you can come and look at all these examples.
(11:29) It&#39;s freaking crazy. Okay. Like, so then there&#39;s examples and then here&#39;s Kimmy&#39;s thoughts, right? So, basically, she she wrote like what she thought about it and how it was similar to like human thought with short-term and long-term memory. And I&#39;m not going to sit here and read through this whole thing, but this is freaking awesome.
(11:52)  Okay? Like, it&#39;s just oh, it it&#39;s freaking awesome. Um because now when I chat with her, she actually remembers stuff because I was fighting with you know working with her and having you know things out of context and I&#39;m like can you send an like even email thing. Oh so one thing I did too was I did connect I had an additional email account right and so I did connect another email account that this one that I used I set it up for some AI cameras back in the day when they didn&#39;t have like their own um email client. you had
(12:24) to add it to a email client. So, I built I added another Gmail account and I basically gave her full rights to that account. So, I told her, you know, only respond if it&#39;s me or my wife that send you a message. And it&#39;s really cool because I told her, I said, also, if it&#39;s my wife, be extra funny and nice because I want her that way that she&#39;ll like you.
(12:45)  So, she actually logged that if my wife sends her an email to ask her a question to be extra nice and, you know, funny. So, I mean that&#39;s so I mean this crap is so crazy, right? So, um anyways, that&#39;s that&#39;s Oh, and this is tonight&#39;s accomplishments. So, this is what we just did, right? Is we is we made all the documents and everything and updated a website and and there is one thing that I did want to mention.
(13:10) So, if you made it this far in the video, this is something that I&#39;ve been doing that when when I didn&#39;t have all the memory stuff working because it I had a lot of back and forth getting this like memory layout working. One thing that I&#39;ve been doing and I continue to do is okay in on my website, right? So, in um sorry, it&#39;s right here.
(13:32)  Uh Deb 2, right? So, in here um there&#39;s actually Well, I&#39;ll just go there real quick. So um um so in here there is a site log MD. Okay. So I sometimes call it a read me. So when I&#39;m doing a project and Kimmy or the AI or whatever is doing something, I update this site log or or the readme in the folder that she&#39;s working in, right? because if if she messes up or something um if something happens and then I don&#39;t want to have to go through the whole thing.
(14:13)  So every time I update the website, I also have her come in here and update this site log, right? So that way there&#39;s like a um well actually I&#39;ll just open it, right? So okay. So, uh, actually, you know, now that I think about it, there might be some stuff in here that is private, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t open it. But anyways, yeah.
(14:37) So, it&#39;s basically, you know, a log. And so, if I&#39;m working like with code or having her do something else, like periodically, I have um I have her, you know, build build an MD file in the directory. Um, and I also like so I I set up some like audit stuff. And so I basically had her build an audit like checklist and I said and so anytime I want to do the audit like you know is something could something be better is something working properly I could say hey do the audit checklist in your direct like so if it&#39;s in the root
(15:13) directory her work work uh what is it work um her working directory whatever it&#39;s called then she&#39;ll just know where it is or now she just knows anyways because of her brain but I just say Hey, follow that follow the uh audit instructions and do all that. That way if something happens in between, she gets all the audit done.
(15:34)  But um I guess the last thing is um I had her and this is pretty cool, right? So I had her build um some Python code to have voice chat in and out. So I ordered a speaker phone from Amazon for 70 bucks that I just plug in USB. So, what I&#39;m going to do is is I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to do pass through to the USB.
(15:58)  And the the code is already set up to where I just need to pass through the USB and plug it in. And it&#39;s it&#39;s a package from Python that I wasn&#39;t familiar with, but it&#39;s it&#39;s created for voice back and forth. And it actually has a wake word, Alexa, and you can&#39;t change it. Now, there&#39;s another one she was telling me about.
(16:15) But what&#39;s going to be freaking awesome is that all I got to do is plug in this USB and the the the Python code is already set up. So, when I&#39;m sitting at my computer, I could just say Alexa and she Kimmy will answer, right? So, I mean, I already have the voice uh back and forth in Telegram.
(16:34)  Um, and it&#39;s pretty cool. But I think I rambled enough so far. So, uh, thanks for watching. If you made it this far, you&#39;re probably probably like one of like five people. So, I appreciate that. Take care.
