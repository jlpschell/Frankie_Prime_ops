(00:00) In the last video, I showed you how to build a personalized AI demo in under 10 minutes. Now, I&#39;m gonna show you how that turns into a paying client who sticks around month after month. This is where the business side kicks in. Let&#39;s start with what happens after you send the demo. The business owner watches it.
(00:17) They&#39;re blown away because it&#39;s personalized to them on a mock version of their site with an AI voice or chat agent that&#39;s already answering questions in real time about their business. They&#39;re out looking at a pitch deck. They&#39;re experiencing the solution firsthand and that creates curiosity.
(00:35) They want to learn more. So what do they do? They click the link that you sent them and book a time on your calendar to have what we call an AI impact assessment call. And this is where the deal gets closed. They&#39;re going to want to know how this can be used in their business. What happens next? How much it costs, but you don&#39;t want to be trying to sell them on the reasons why they should use it.
(00:57) Instead, you want to have a conversation where they personally identify with the journey that their customers or prospects have so that they can have the epiphany themselves of, oh yeah, this is how my customers use it. This is how prospects are probably looking for me. You&#39;re not forcing anything on them.
(01:16) You&#39;re helping them have that aha moment. So here&#39;s how that conversation goes in three, two, one. Hey, so let me ask you something. When you need something, say a product or a service, where do you usually search for it? They&#39;ll say, oh, I usually go to Google. You&#39;ll be like, yep, most of us do.
(01:34) When you search on Google, do you ever go past the second page? They&#39;re gonna be like, heck, I rarely ever go past the first page. You&#39;ll be like, yeah, makes sense. Again, most of us are the same way. So when you&#39;re on the first page, how do you determine who you&#39;re gonna reach out to, who you&#39;re gonna call? They&#39;re gonna say, well, Usually whoever is at the top or has the best reviews or the most reviews, you&#39;re going to be like, yeah, most everyone does the same.
(02:02) So do you usually only call one business? They&#39;ll be like, no, I typically call two or three. You&#39;ll be like, got it. So let&#39;s say you call the first one and they don&#39;t answer. What do do? They&#39;ll be like, well, I call the next one. And if that one doesn&#39;t answer either, what do you do? Well, I call the next.
(02:23) So basically you go with the business that picks up the phone and answers your questions and helps you move forward, whether that&#39;s buying something or booking an appointment or just getting your questions answered. And they&#39;re like, yeah, exactly. And then you&#39;re like, well, perfect. So would it be fair to say that your customers probably behave in that same way? And they&#39;ll be like, yeah, that makes sense.
(02:45) And then you&#39;re gonna say, and would you agree that if your business isn&#39;t engaging and leads the right way, whether by phone or chat or by text, that those leads are probably bouncing to your competitors. And they&#39;re gonna be like, yeah, that&#39;s probably true. And then you&#39;re gonna say, so let me ask you, can you see any reason why you wouldn&#39;t wanna implement this that closes the gap and makes you never miss a lead again? And that&#39;s the moment when they get it.
(03:10) You&#39;re not pitching the software, you&#39;re helping them solve a painful, expensive problem. And the solution is simple, AI voice or AI chat that engages with every lead. Whether they call at 10 a.m. or 10 p.m., whether they type or talk, whether they visit the site or click an ad, you become the person who sets that up for them.
(03:31) You handle the install, you manage the automations, you keep the AI agent engaged. You give them peace of mind, and they happily pay $297 to $997 a month for it because it works, because it saves them time, because it makes them money. And guess what? You can scale this. Once you&#39;ve got your first client, just repeat the process.
(03:52) You already have the tools. You already have the system. You already have the snapshot. All you need is a steady flow of new prospects, which I&#39;ll show you how to get them, a simple daily routine of reaching out, sending the demos, booking the calls, and a plan to manage clients without getting buried, as you&#39;ll see that too.
(04:12) And so this is how you launch your AI SaaS agency right now. Even if you&#39;re starting from scratch, even if you&#39;ve never sold anything before, even if you&#39;ve tried side hustles that didn&#39;t work, because now you have a proven offer businesses want, a demo that does all the selling for you, and a system that can be set up in a day, and a huge wave of demand coming your way.
(04:35) You just need to catch it. If you haven&#39;t watched my video that shows my exact system for selling AI voice and chat, no pitching needed, be sure and go back and watch that next, because that shows exactly how to generate demand and get businesses asking you for the demo.
