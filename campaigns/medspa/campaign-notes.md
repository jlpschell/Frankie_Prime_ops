# MedSpa Campaign - Voicemail Scripts

## Version 1 (Pain-focused)
"Hey there, this is Jason. I was doing some research on medspas in the DFW area and came across yours. Most medspa owners I talk to have the same issue — booked solid some weeks, then empty chairs the next. Never really consistent, you know? I help fix that and can prove we'll get you 25-30% more appointments on your books in the next 45 days. If you want a free breakdown of how to keep your schedule full year-round, give me a call back or shoot me a quick text. Completely free. Talk to you soon!"

## Version 2 (Social proof)
"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just looking into medspas in the DFW area and found yours. I just helped another medspa increase their monthly bookings by about 25% in like 45 days... without them lifting a finger. So if you want me to walk you through how we did it and build something custom for your business at no cost, just give me a call back or shoot me a text for more info. Talk to you soon!"

## Version 3 (Referral angle)
"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just doing some research on medspas in the DFW area and came across yours. I recently worked with another medspa — they were pretty much relying only on Instagram and word of mouth, so we got them to about 25-30% more appointments every month. And it's completely on autopilot now. They don't even think about it. So anyway, if you want me to walk you through exactly how we pulled that off, I can put together something custom for your business, no charge. Just give me a call back at this number. Talk to you soon!"

# MedSpa Campaign - Follow-Up Texts (7-10 Day Drip)

## Text 1 (Day 2 after voicemail)
Hey [First Name], this is Jason. Left you a voicemail about helping medspas in DFW stay fully booked. Worth a quick chat?

## Text 2 (Day 4)
[First Name] - just following up. I put together a free breakdown for medspa owners on how to add 25-30% more appointments without spending more on ads. Want me to send it over?

## Text 3 (Day 7)
Hey [First Name], last one from me. If filling empty appointment slots isn't a problem for you, no worries. But if it is, I've got something that works. Just reply "info" and I'll send it.

## Text 4 (Day 10 - optional breakup)
[First Name] - closing the loop on this. If you ever want to chat about keeping your chairs full, I'm here. Good luck out there.
