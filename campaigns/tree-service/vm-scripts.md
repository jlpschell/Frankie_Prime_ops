# Tree Service — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with tree service companies in the DFW area. After every storm, your phone blows up — but you're out running a crew with chainsaws, not answering calls. By the time you call back, that homeowner already booked someone else. We built a system that answers every call, qualifies the job, and books the estimate while you're still clearing the last one. If missed calls are costing you jobs, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a tree service company near McKinney stop losing storm leads. He was missing 10+ calls after every big weather event. Now his AI handles every call and he's booking more removals than his crews can get to. Same system, takes 15 minutes to set up. Worth a quick look? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you've got more trees to cut than your crew can get to, that's a good problem. But if you know another tree guy losing work to slow callbacks, send them my way — I'll take care of you. Either way, offer stands. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
