# Fire Damage Restoration — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with restoration companies in the DFW area. When someone's house just had a fire, they're panicking and calling every number they can find — they go with whoever answers first. We built a system that answers every call instantly, 24/7, qualifies the damage, and books your crew before the homeowner even calls the next company. If you're losing fire damage jobs to slow response, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — a fire damage job is what, $10,000 to $80,000? And it goes to whoever responds first. We just helped a restoration company stop losing those calls to voicemail. Their AI answers instantly, gets the address and damage details, and dispatches the team while the adjuster's still on the way. Worth 10 minutes to see it? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If your crew is booked solid on jobs right now, I respect that. But if you know another restoration company that's tired of losing big jobs to slow callbacks, send them my way — I'll make it worth your while. Either way, the offer stands. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
