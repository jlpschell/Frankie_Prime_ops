# Painters VM Scripts
## DFW Campaign — February 2026

## VM Version 1 — Pain-focused (Feast or Famine)
**Duration:** 25-30 seconds

"Hey there, this is Jason. I was doing some research on painting companies in the DFW area and came across yours. Most painting company owners I talk to have the same problem — busy season hits and you're drowning, then it dries up and you're chasing work. Never really consistent, you know? I help fix that and can prove we'll get you 25-30% more jobs on your schedule in the next 45 days. If you want a free breakdown of how to keep your crews busy year-round, give me a call back or shoot me a quick text. Completely free. Talk to you soon!"

## VM Version 2 — Social Proof
**Duration:** 20-25 seconds

"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just looking into painting companies in the DFW area and found yours. I just helped another painting company increase their monthly jobs by about 25% in like 45 days... without them lifting a finger. So if you want me to walk you through how we did it and build something custom for your business at no cost, just give me a call back or shoot me a text for more info. Talk to you soon!"

## VM Version 3 — Referral Angle
**Duration:** 25-30 seconds

"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just doing some research on painting companies in the DFW area and came across yours. I recently worked with another painter — they were pretty much relying only on word of mouth and past customers, so we got them to like 25-30% more jobs every month. And it's completely on autopilot now. They don't even think about it. So anyway, if you want me to walk you through exactly how we pulled that off, I can put together something custom for your business, no charge. Just give me a call back at this number. Talk to you soon!"
