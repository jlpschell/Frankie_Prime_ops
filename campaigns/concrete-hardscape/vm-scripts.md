# Concrete & Hardscape — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with concrete contractors in the DFW area, and I know your problem — once you start a pour, you can't stop to answer the phone. By the time you call back, that homeowner already got three other quotes. We built a system that answers your calls instantly, qualifies the project scope, and books the estimate while you're still finishing the job. If missed calls are costing you work, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a concrete contractor in Allen go from missing 6-7 calls a week to catching every single one. He booked 12 more estimates last month without changing anything else. Same system, works for flatwork, foundations, hardscape — any concrete operation. Worth 10 minutes? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you're booked through summer and don't need more leads, that's a good sign. But if you know another concrete guy who's tired of losing jobs to whoever calls back first, send them my way. I'll make it worth your while. Either way, offer's open. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
