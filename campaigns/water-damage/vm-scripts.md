# Water Damage Restoration — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is [Agent] with Human Led AI. I work with restoration companies in the DFW area, and I know your phone rings off the hook after every storm — but half those leads slip through because you're on a job site. We built a system that answers every call, qualifies the emergency, and books the job before your competition even calls back. If you're losing water damage leads to slow response times, I'd love to show you how we fix that. Call me back at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], [Agent] again from Human Led AI. Wanted to follow up — we just helped a restoration company in Arlington capture 12 extra emergency calls last month that would've gone to voicemail. In your business, a missed call on a burst pipe is a $3,000 job walking to someone else. Our AI answers instantly, 24/7, and gets your crew dispatched while the water's still rising. Worth a quick call? Hit me back at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], [Agent] one more time. Look, if you're fully booked and don't need more water damage calls, I get it — that's a good problem. But if you know another restoration company that's hungry for more emergency work, send them my way and I'll take care of you. Either way, the offer stands — we help restoration companies never miss another lead. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
