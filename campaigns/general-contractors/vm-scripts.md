# General Contractors — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is [Agent] with Human Led AI. I work with general contractors in DFW, and here's what I keep hearing — you're on the job site all day, phone's blowing up, and by the time you call people back, they've already hired someone else. We built a system that answers your calls instantly, qualifies the lead, and books the estimate before you even put your tools down. If missed calls are costing you jobs, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], [Agent] again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a GC in Plano stop losing leads to voicemail. He was missing 8-10 calls a week while running crews. Now his AI assistant handles it and he's booking 40% more estimates without lifting a finger. Same system, works for any trade. Worth 10 minutes to see it? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], [Agent] one last time. If you've got more work than you can handle right now, I respect that — means you're doing something right. But if you know another contractor who's tired of losing jobs to slow callbacks, send them my way. I'll make it worth your while. Either way, offer's open — [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds

## Recording Notes
- Voice: Brian or Chris (ElevenLabs)
- Tone: Blue-collar respect — GCs don't want slick sales talk
- Emphasis: "on the job site," "without lifting a finger"
