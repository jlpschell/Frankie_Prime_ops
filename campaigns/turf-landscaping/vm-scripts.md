# Turf & Landscaping — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with landscaping companies in the DFW area, and here's what I keep hearing — you're out running crews all day, phone's blowing up, and by the time you call people back, they already hired someone off Nextdoor. We built a system that answers your calls instantly, qualifies the job, and books the estimate before your competition even sees the lead. If missed calls are costing you contracts, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a landscaping company in McKinney go from missing 10 calls a week to catching every single one. He's booking 40% more recurring contracts without hiring a receptionist. Same system, works for turf, hardscape, full-service — any landscaping operation. Worth 10 minutes to see it? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If your schedule's packed and you don't need more leads, good for you — that's the dream. But if you know another landscaper who's losing jobs to slow callbacks, send them my way. I'll take care of you for the referral. Either way, the offer stands. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
