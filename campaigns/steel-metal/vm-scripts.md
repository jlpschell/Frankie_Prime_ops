# Steel & Metal Buildings — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with steel building and barndominium companies in the DFW area. Your projects are big-ticket — barndos, shops, warehouses — and one missed call could be a six-figure job walking to someone else. We built a system that answers every call instantly, qualifies the project, and books the consultation while you're still on the job site. If you're losing big projects to slow callbacks, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a metal building company near Rockwall stop losing leads to voicemail. He was missing calls during the day and losing out on bids. Now every call gets answered and he's quoting 40% more projects. Same system, takes 15 minutes. Worth a quick look? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you've got more projects than you can bid right now, that's a great position. But if you know another steel building company that's losing bids to slow response times, send them my way. I'll take care of you for the referral. Either way, offer stands. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
