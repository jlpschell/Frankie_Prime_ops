## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with septic companies in the DFW area, and I know your world — emergencies don't wait for business hours. When someone's septic backs up at 10pm, they're calling every company in the phone book until someone answers. We built a system that answers every call, 24/7, qualifies the emergency, and gets your crew dispatched while the other guys are still sleeping. If you're losing emergency jobs to slow response, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a septic company near Rockwall capture 8 extra emergency calls last month that would've gone to voicemail. In your business, a missed call on a backed-up system is a $2,000-$5,000 job walking to someone else. Our AI answers instantly, day or night. Worth a quick call? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you're slammed with work and don't need more emergency calls, that's a great problem to have. But if you know another septic company that's losing jobs to slow callbacks, send them my way — I'll take care of you. Either way, the offer stands. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
