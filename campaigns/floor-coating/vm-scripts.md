# Floor Coating & Epoxy — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with floor coating companies in the DFW area. I know your deal — once you start laying epoxy, you can't stop to take a call. And once that coat's down, you've got cure time where you're stuck on site. Meanwhile, leads are calling and nobody's answering. We built a system that catches every call, qualifies the project, and books the estimate while you're working. If missed calls are costing you jobs, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a floor coating company in the DFW area go from missing calls all day to catching every single one. He booked 8 more estimates last month — that's $15K-$20K in extra revenue just from answering the phone. Same system, 15 minutes to set up. Worth a look? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you're booked out on garage floors and commercial jobs, that's awesome. But if you know another coating company that's losing leads to voicemail, send them my way — I'll take care of you. Either way, offer's open. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
