# Garage Door Services — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with garage door companies in the DFW area. When someone's garage door is stuck open or won't close, they're not leaving a voicemail and waiting — they're calling the next company. We built a system that answers every call instantly, qualifies the job, and books the appointment before your competition even sees the missed call. If you're losing service calls to slow response, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a garage door company in Plano catch 15 extra service calls last month that would've gone to voicemail. In your business, a missed call on a broken spring is a $400-$800 job walking to someone else. Our AI answers instantly, day or night. Worth a quick call? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you've got more installs than you can handle right now, good for you. But if you know another garage door company losing service calls to voicemail, send them my way — I'll take care of you. Either way, the offer stands. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
