# Pool Builders — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with pool builders in the DFW area, and I keep hearing the same thing — you're out on a build site, phone's ringing, and by the time you call back, that homeowner already got three other quotes. We built a system that answers your calls instantly, qualifies the project, and books the consultation while you're still pouring gunite. If missed calls are costing you pool jobs, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped a pool builder in Frisco stop losing leads to voicemail. He was missing 5-6 calls a week during build season. Now his AI handles initial calls and he's booking 35% more consultations without chasing people down. Same system, takes 15 minutes to set up. Worth a quick look? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you've got more builds than you can handle right now, that's a good problem. But if you know another pool company that's tired of losing jobs to slow callbacks, send them my way — I'll make it worth your while. Either way, offer's open. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
