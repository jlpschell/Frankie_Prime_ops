## VM Version 1 — Curiosity Hook
**Duration:** 20-25 seconds

"Hey, this is Jay. I was looking into roofing companies in the DFW area and stumbled onto yours. Wanted to reach out because I've got something that's been helping contractors like you pick up an extra 20 to 30 jobs a month without spending more on ads. Thought it might be worth a quick conversation. Give me a shout back when you get a sec — I'll shoot you a text too so you've got my number."

## VM Version 2 — Missed Calls Problem
**Duration:** 20-25 seconds

"Hey, it's Jay. Quick question for you — when you're up on a roof or running between jobs, how many calls are you missing? I've been working with a few roofing guys in the area on something that handles that problem. Might be useful for you, might not — but figured I'd reach out. Hit me back when you get a chance, I'll text you too."

## VM Version 3 — Speed to Lead
**Duration:** 20-25 seconds

"Hey, this is Jay. I know you're busy so I'll keep it short — homeowners usually go with whoever calls back first. I've been helping a few contractors around DFW make sure they're always that guy. If you're interested in picking up more jobs without working more hours, give me a call back. I'll text you so you've got my info."
