# HVAC VM Scripts
## DFW Campaign — February 2026

## VM Version 1 — Pain-focused (Seasonal Inconsistency)
**Duration:** 25-30 seconds

"Hey there, this is Jason. I was doing some research on HVAC companies in the DFW area and came across yours. Most HVAC owners I talk to are either slammed during summer and winter, then crickets in between — never really consistent, you know? I help fix that and can prove we'll get you 25-30% more service calls in the next 45 days. If you want a free breakdown of how to fill your schedule year-round, give me a call back or shoot me a quick text. I'll put something together specifically for your business, completely free. Talk to you soon!"

## VM Version 2 — Social Proof
**Duration:** 20-25 seconds

"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just looking into HVAC companies in the DFW area and found yours. I recently helped another HVAC company increase their monthly service calls by about 25% in like 45 days... without them lifting a finger. So if you want me to walk you through how we did it and build something custom for your business at no cost, just give me a call back or shoot me a text for more info. Talk to you soon!"

## VM Version 3 — Referral Angle
**Duration:** 25-30 seconds

"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just doing some research on HVAC companies in the DFW area and came across yours. I recently worked with another HVAC company — they were pretty much relying only on referrals and repeat customers, so we got them to about 25-30% more jobs every month. And it's completely on autopilot now. They don't even think about it. So anyway, if you want me to walk you through exactly how we pulled that off, I can put together something custom for your business, no charge. Just give me a call back at this number. Talk to you soon!"
