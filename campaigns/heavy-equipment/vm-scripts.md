# Heavy Equipment Services — VM Scripts

## V1: Pain Point (First Touch)
"Hey [Name], this is Jay with Human Led AI. I work with heavy equipment operators in the DFW area. I know your guys are running dozers and excavators all day — nobody's sitting by the phone. When a general contractor needs a site graded or a foundation dug, they call who picks up. We built a system that answers every call, qualifies the project, and gets your bid in the pipeline before the competition even checks their voicemail. If you're missing out on jobs because you're in the dirt, let's fix that. Call me at [number]."

**Duration:** ~25 seconds

## V2: Social Proof (Second Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay again from Human Led AI. Quick follow-up — we just helped an excavation company near Rockwall catch job requests they were missing during the day. In your business, a missed call on a site prep job is $5,000 to $50,000 walking to someone else. Our AI answers instantly and gets you the details so you can bid while the iron's still warm. Worth a quick call? [number]."

**Duration:** ~22 seconds

## V3: Referral Play (Third Touch)
"Hey [Name], Jay one last time. If you've got more work than your fleet can handle right now, that's a great problem. But if you know another equipment operator losing jobs to slow callbacks, send them my way — I'll take care of you for the referral. Either way, offer's open. [number] when you're ready."

**Duration:** ~20 seconds
