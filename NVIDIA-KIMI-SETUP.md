# NVIDIA Kimi 2.5 — Completely FREE Setup

## What This Is
NVIDIA hosts **Kimi 2.5 for FREE** through their Moonshot developer platform. No rate limits mentioned in the transcript. This could be our primary model.

## Setup Process (From Transcript)

### Step 1: Get NVIDIA API Key
1. Go to **NVIDIA Moonshot website** (need URL from description)
2. Create free NVIDIA account 
3. Verify with phone number
4. Select "Kimi 2.5" in top left
5. Click "View Code" → "Generate API Key"
6. Copy key (starts with `NV_API`)

### Step 2: Add to OpenClaw Environment
Add environment variable:
```bash
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=NV_API[your_key_here]
```

### Step 3: Update OpenClaw JSON Config
The transcript mentions JSON config to point OpenClaw at Kimi 2.5. Need to extract this from the video description.

## Why This Changes Everything
- **100% FREE** (no credits, no limits mentioned)
- **Hosted by NVIDIA** (reliable infrastructure)
- **Compatible with OpenClaw** (proven setup)
- **Better than Gemini Flash** (no rate limits)

## Action Items
1. Find NVIDIA Moonshot URL 
2. Get the JSON config from video description
3. Test API signup process
4. Add Kimi to our model configs
5. Set as default model

**This could eliminate ALL model costs. Way better than the 93% savings I projected.**

Need the video description link to get the exact JSON config. Do you have access to that?
