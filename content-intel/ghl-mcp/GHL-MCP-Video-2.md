Most local businesses are doing AI completely wrong. They think AI is about chat bots or chat GPT or maybe some automation or some shiny new tool that they'll look at later. But the real opportunity isn't any of that. The real opportunity is turning their website into the hardest working employee in their business. A website that talks, a website that answers questions, a website that engages prospects instead of letting them leave. Because here's the truth. Most local businesses websites are leaking revenue. Not because they look bad, although some of them do, but because they don't engage. They just sit there. They make people hunt for answers. And when a prospect can't get what they need quickly, they leave. They click back and they go to a competitor. And that single moment costs a business real money. And most of them don't even realize it's happening. What's changing right now is real simple. Websites are no longer static digital brochures. They're becoming the front door to businesses again. And that front door is starting to talk. Instead of scrolling pages, prospects just ask questions. They get answers. They get their appointments booked. They move forward. And that's what an AI voice agent makes possible. And this is why talking websites are one of the biggest opportunities for local business and for anyone building an AI agency right now. Most businesses don't have this yet, but they will. And the people who understand it early have a massive advantage. Now, here's the important part. This isn't complicated. This isn't futuristic, and it doesn't require custom code or massive development projects. I'm going to show you this step by step. Let's start with the website. A lot of local businesses don't even have a site that they like or they have something that's outdated or confusing or slow. So instead of rebuilding everything from scratch, I start inside of Goh High Level. I choose a niche specific website template and in minutes I can have a site up that's clean, professional for almost any type of business. This alone already puts them ahead of most of their competitors. We're in my highle account. I've got a sub account I call demo company just to do demo stuff with. So let's go into websites and create a new website. We're going to choose from templates. Hit continue. Now let's search for a law firm. And here we are. We have several to choose from. Let's go with this one right here. And we'll preview the template. Yep, this looks good. So let's choose the template. And now it's going to add it to our high level sub account. So the website has populated in our account. Now what we're going to do is we're going to go inside and we're going to edit it to make it reflective of our customers business. You can use AI right here to ask it questions and have it assist you. You can just come in here and upload their logo. You can um adjust any of the copy that you want to adjust. You can see this is an amazing looking website right from the get- go. You can do minimal edits or you can do extensive edits. It is completely up to you. But is a website that's already designed for you. There are multiple pages to the website. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to create the AI agent and the AI web chat that we're going to put on this website for our customer. One of the things you do when you create a new website in Highle, whether you use one of their templates or you create it from scratch yourself, is you have to attach your domain to it. So, we're going to go to settings and I'm going to select the domain demo biz site, which that's something that I use just for demo sites. And I'm going to hit save. Now, let me come back to the big difference. This website doesn't just exist. It engages. When a prospect lands here and they don't have to guess, they don't have to scroll. They don't have to fill out a form and wait for someone to respond to them. They ask questions and immediately get answers. That's because the next step is adding the AI voice agent that lives directly on the website. This agent is trained for this specific niche, for this specific business, this specific customer. Next, we're going to go to the AI agents and we're going to create a voice agent for this law firm. Now, I'm going to go to Google and I'm going to type in personal injury attorney Dallas, Texas. Let's grab this one. Okay, this looks good. They have a lot of information. They don't have a web chat, right? to have this form which is you know the old antiquated way. Just think about if you need an attorney you come to this one or you go to the other ones you know you've got to fill in a form as opposed to talking to a website agent that can get you information right away. Now I'm going to use my GPT prompter that helps build the prompt for voice agents for particular business. So it's asking me for their website. I'm going to put their website in here. Okay. And it's grabbing everything it needs from them. Okay, now it's going to ask me some questions. I'm just going to answer those questions. It's going to help me build the prompt. So, it to ask me their business name. I gave it the actual business name. Now, I don't know who these people are. I'm just doing this as an example to show you. I'm going to say none. Yes. Yes. Okay. Now, it wants to confirm the services. Look through those. Those look good. I'm gonna say yes. Now, what would you like the AI's voice name to be? I'll just stick with Ally for consistency. Any additional links? I'm going to say none. Okay. It's asking me if I'd like an FAQ. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say to it, based on the services that I provide and based on the information you've grabbed from the website, I want you to suggest FAQs. Perfect. Now, it's given me some example FAQs. And when you're working with the client, you're going to go over their FAQs with them to make sure you have everything that they need built into their knowledge base. But for this, I'm just doing this to show you really quick how the process is done and so that you can create a quick AI agent. Now, it's asking me if I want to ask have my voice agent ask for the zip code during the call. And I'll say no. What type of tri call are we trying to book? I'm going to say um a consultation and an appointment. Now it's saying, "Are there any goals you would like Ally to accomplish during the call? Collect the caller's name and email. Book a consultation. Transfer to a live agent." I'm going to say these right here. This looks good. I'm going to say it looks good. Now it says, "Do you want Ally to collect any additional information from the caller like reason for the call?" And so in this case, I would say yes, reason for the call would be a good one because we want to know why they're calling the law firm. Then it's suggesting some discovery questions. Say those look good. Okay, now it has the necessary information to create a prompt for us. So I'm going to copy this code. I'm going to go back to high level and put this prompt in the AI voice agent. So, we're going to create a voice agent list. We'll start with creating an agent, a custom agent. Going to hit continue. Agent name is Ally. For name, I'm just going to create something uh fake to put in here. >> Hey, worldly 11 Labs friends, let's Hey, worldly 11 Labs friends, let's talk. >> All right, we're going to come back and change this initial message. So, we're going to leave it like this for now, but come change it. >> Now, we're going to switch to advanced mode. And this prompt that comes standard, we're going to delete it and we're going to add in the new prompt that we got here from our prompter. And as you can see, it gives us background information. You are Ally, a cheerful, upbeat receptionist for Thompson Law. Now, I'm actually going to change that to say the law firm. Now, as I scroll down through this custom prompt that we just created, I'm looking for the introduction message, which is right here. or conversation flow. Hi, thanks for calling the law firm. This is Ally. How can I help you today? So, I'm going to copy that. I'm going to go through the rest of this. Make sure it looks correct. Looks good. Okay, I'm going to save this. Normally, I would trigger different workflows when this call is completed, but I'm just showing this as a demo call. Also, any recipient you want could get a transcript of this conversation. You select that there, whether you want it to be an admin or go to a particular email. I'm going to hit next. I'm going to go back to the initial agent details and I'm going to paste in this initial message that I got from the prompt where it says, "Hi, thanks for calling the law firm. This is Ally. How can I help you today?" And now we're going to test it. Uh, you can make a phone call, but since I'm just doing this on their website, I'm just going to make a web call and I'm going to say start call. >> Hi, thanks for calling the law firm. This is Ally. How can I help you today? Hey Ally, I was recently in an accident where a semi-truck sideswiped me and um and I'm pretty sure it was to their negligence and I'm just trying to figure out what to do. >> Oh no, that sounds really stressful. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Let's get you the help you need. >> Okay, so just like that, you can test it before you implement it live. Once the agent is ready, I drop it into the voice enabled web chat and then I embed that web chat right onto the website that I built at high level. And now the website talks. The next thing we're going to do is we're going to take our AI voice agent that we just created, put that voice agent in a web chat widget and then we're going to put that on the website that we created. So we're going to go here to sites and we're going to go to chat widget and we're going to start a new widget and we're going to make it a voice AI widget. Okay, we're going to name it Alley Voice Law. Now, here you can customize the widget any way you want to customize it. I'm not going to spend too much time on that. It's pretty self-explanatory. You want a picture or no picture? Do you want different phone images, etc. Uh what color theme do you want it? Or you can choose and create your own. You've got uh a welcome message that you can edit quite easily. You can choose different avatars that you want. So, if you've got an AI avatar that you've created, maybe you've used my custom AI avatar builder where you build one unique for your business or unique for your customers business. Right now, we'll just stick with this. And then you can put it anywhere on the screen wherever you want it. We're going to leave it in the bottom right corner. And on the chat window itself, you can have it say anything you want to. So, we've got talk to us, call us here. I'm going to leave my branding on here so they know where it's coming from. I'm going to turn off HIPPA messaging. I'm going to keep this one in English, but you can choose other languages. On the AI voice, I'm going to choose Ali Law. That's the one we just built. And this looks good. So, I'm going to hit save. Since I'm building this in highle for a highle website, I don't need to get code or anything. It's already automatically going to be there. So, when I go back to websites and I choose the personal injury lawyer and I go to settings, then I can come down here and choose the widget that I want and I'm going to choose law alley voice and I'm going to hit save. So, let me show you what this actually sounds like. I'm going to roleplay as a real prospect. I'm going to ask it real questions and you'll hear how natural this interaction is. And so, now let's take a look at the site that we just created. Clearly, it hasn't been edited yet to whoever your customer would be. You'd put their logo in here and change their information to be reflective of them. Uh, but here's our AI agent that we just created. So, let's give it a try. >> Hi, thanks for calling the law firm. This is Ally. How can I help you today? >> Hey, Ally. I was just in an auto accident and and I think I need legal help. >> I'm so sorry to hear about your accident. I'm here to help. Can I start by getting your first and last name? >> Steve Jones. >> Thanks, Steve. Just to confirm that's s t e v e j j o n e s, right? >> Yes. >> Got it. Steve, now could I get your email address to keep in touch? >> Sure. It's Steve Jones123 atgmail.com. >> Thanks, Steve. Just to confirm, your email is s123 gm a i l.com. Correct. >> Yes, that's correct. >> Thank you. Now, can you briefly describe what happened during your accident? This will help us understand your situation better. >> Sure. I was just minding my own business, driving down the the highway, and uh one of those big semitrs veered into my lane and ran me off the road. >> Oh, no. That sounds terrifying, Steve. I'm really sorry you had to go through that. Were there any injuries as a result of the accident? >> Uh, yes. >> I'm so sorry to hear that, Steve. Have you received any medical treatment for your injuries yet? >> Yes, that's kind of ongoing. >> Thanks for letting me know. Was a police report filed for the accident? >> Yes, it was. >> Got it. And is the other party's insurance involved in this case? >> They were a hit and run. We just got the name of the trucking company. >> Understood, Steve. That definitely complicates things, but having the trucking company's name is a good start. Have you spoken with any other attorneys about this case yet? >> Uh, no. You're my first call. >> Thanks for sharing all that, Steve. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and we'd love to help you navigate this. Would you like to schedule a consultation with one of our attorneys to discuss your case in detail? >> Sure. How does that work? >> Great. The consultation is completely free and during it, one of our attorneys will go over your case, answer your questions, and explain your options moving forward. Let me check our availability. Do you have a preferred day or time for the consultation? >> Uh, I'm pretty open this week. >> All right, let me take a look. How about tomorrow, Monday, February 2nd? We could do something in the morning, afternoon, or evening. What works best for you? >> Uh, tomorrow afternoon around 3. >> Got it. Tomorrow, Monday, February 2nd, at 3 p.m. Let me confirm that for you. One moment. All right, you're all set for your consultation. Is there anything else I can help you with, Steve? >> Is there anything I need to bring with me? This would be my first time that I've ever had done anything like this. >> Great question, Steve. For your consultation, it's helpful to bring any documents related to the accident. That could include the police report, medical records or bills, photos of the accident or your injuries, and any communication you've had with the trucking company or insurance. Don't worry if you don't have everything. Just bring what you can, and the attorney will guide you from there. Anything else on your mind? >> No. And you said this doesn't cost anything initially. >> That's right, Steve. Your initial consultation is completely free. Plus, we work on a contingency fee basis, so you don't pay anything unless we win your case. If there's nothing else, I'll let you go for now. We're looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow at 300 p.m. Take care and have a great day. >> Thank you. Bye-bye. The AI Voice Agent can answer common questions, handle objections, explain services, book appointments, and route leads exactly where they need to go. This is what turns a static website into a talking website that helps businesses engage more leads and get more sales. Once businesses see this, everything clicks. They stop thinking about what features you have and they start thinking about their missed calls, their lost leads, their after hours inquiries and staff bandwidth. And they see how AI voice fills those gaps automatically. This is also where most agencies get it wrong. They overexlain AI. They talk about AI. They don't demonstrate it. Talking websites fix that. They let prospects experience the value immediately. And this is where the math becomes a no-brainer. If this system helps a business close just one extra deal a month, it more than pays for itself. So, think about it. If you're a landscaper and one extra job is worth $2,500 a month or more. If you're an attorney and that one extra client is worth $10,000 a month or more. If you're a custom remodeler and one project is worth $25,000 or more. If you're a home builder and one deal is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, just capturing one of those opportunities that would have otherwise slipped through the cracks easily justifies the cost. And I can assure you, they're going to get more than just one. This is a service that you can confidently price at 300, $500, even $1,000 a month. And in most cases, I recommend at least $500 a month. For a business, the ROI is obvious. And for you as the agency, you set it up once and you get paid every month as recurring income. Now, think about this. If you sign up just 20 businesses at $500 a month, that is $10,000 a month in monthly recurring revenue. And that's not even counting setup fees. Right now, I'm just talking about predictable monthly recurring revenue. This can start as a side hustle and then turn into an amazing full-time business, one that compounds, one that scales, and one that has the potential to be genuinely life-changing, just like it has been for me. That's why this market feels like a gold rush. Not because it's hype, but because adoption is still early, and the gap between what businesses need and what they currently have is massive. And if you're building an AI agency, this gives you a simple offer. We turn your websites into a 24/7 sales engagement system. It's easy to understand, it's easy to demo, and it's easy to sell. And if you're a business owner, this solves a real problem. More engagement, more qualified conversations, more booked appointments without adding any staff. This is exactly why I've built my system around talking websites, AI voice agents, AI chat agents, and simple demos that make the value obvious. This is still early, but not for long. Talking websites are becoming the new standard, and the best time to understand them is before everyone else catches up.
