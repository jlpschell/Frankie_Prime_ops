A lot of people have been asking me how I'm doing these AI voice demos. Specifically, how does the AI sound like it actually works for the prospect's business and how does it instantly click for people when they experience it? So, in this video, I'm going to do three things. First, I'm going to explain why this matters. Secondly, I'm going to let you experience it. And then third, I'm going to pull back the curtain and show you how to build it using High Level. Here's the key idea. Most people still truly don't understand AI. They've heard about it. They've played with chat GBT, but very few businesses are actually using AI to run conversations inside of their business. And that creates a problem because AI is so powerful. But belief doesn't come from explanations. It comes from experiencing it. You can't tell someone how good AI is. You have to let them interact with it. That's why role-play demos work so well. Instead of saying, "Here's what AI could do." We let the AI say, "Here's what I would do if I worked in your business." So, let's stop talking about it and let me just show you. All right. Now, I'm on my site. We're going to do a demo with the AI voice agent just like one of our prospects would have a demo with it where it will roleplay as if it would work for their business. So, let's give it a shot. >> Hi, I'm Jenna, the friendly AI assistant at Biz Dominance. Today I want to show you how I can act as a custom voice AI agent for your business. Can I show you a quick demo? >> Sure. >> Awesome. Thanks. First, could I get your first and last name? I'll confirm the spelling before we move on. >> Okay. It's Dar Holdzsworth. >> Just to confirm, your name is D A R H O L D S W O R T H. >> Correct. >> Great. Thanks, Dar. All right. I'll ask a few questions about your business. Then I'll roleplay as your AI assistant and show how I'd interact with your customers. Sound good? >> Sounds good. >> Perfect. What's the name of your business? >> Floral Dreams. >> Thanks, Dar. Let me make sure I got that right. Your business is called Floral Dreams. >> That's correct. >> All right. Thanks for confirming. Tell me a bit about Floral Dreams. What industry are you in and who's your primary customer? Well, we're a florist. We do flowers, all kinds of amazing flowers. Our customers are just everyday humans, uh, wanting to send flowers and bouquets, uh, to people they care about. Got it. So, you're a florist offering a variety of flowers and bouquets for anyone wanting to send something special to people they care about. That paints a clear picture. Thanks. Great. Thanks for sharing that. So, now I'll act as your voice AI assistant for Floral Dreams, and you pretend you're one of your potential customers. This will show you how I'd interact with your customers. Let's get started. Hi, thanks for calling Floral Dreams. I'm Jenna, your voice AI assistant. How can I help you today? >> Hey Jenna, it's my wife's birthday tomorrow and I'd like to like to send some flowers to her. >> Absolutely, I can help with that. May I know what kind of flowers or bouquet you have in mind? or would you like some suggestions? And do you already have a delivery address in mind? >> I do have a delivery address, but let's let's see if you can get get me set up with a good um a good bouquet of flowers first. She doesn't like stuff that's like cheesy like most people will get. She wants something really unique. >> Thanks for sharing that. Sounds like she's got great taste. I can recommend a unique custom bouquet with a mix of seasonal blooms and some rare flowers for that extra wow factor. Would you like to add any favorite colors or specific flowers she loves, or should I just go all in on the unique and elegant vibe? >> Well, what are the rare flowers that you're thinking of? >> Great question. I'm unable to pull up our current rare flower inventory right now, but a team member will reach out to you with some unique options and help you pick the perfect bouquet. In the meantime, could you share the delivery address? I'll make sure we have all your details ready for when our team follows up. >> Sure. It's 123 Main Street. >> Just to confirm, that's 123 Main Street. >> Yes. >> Perfect. Thanks. Is there a specific time tomorrow you'd like the flowers delivered or should we aim for standard delivery during the day? >> Uh, anytime tomorrow as long as she gets them before No, you know what? Let's get them to her early. Can you get them before noon? >> Got it. You'd like the flowers delivered before noon tomorrow. I'll make a note of that. Is there anything special you'd like written on the card or should we keep it simple? >> Let's keep it simple for now. >> Sounds good. I'll keep the card message simple. Is there anything else you'd like to add or does that cover everything for your order? >> That covers everything. >> Great. Thanks for all the details. I'll pass this along so our team can follow up with unique bouquet options and confirm your order for delivery before noon tomorrow. That wraps up the demo. I hope this gave you a clear picture of how I could operate as your voice AI assistant for Floral Dreams. If there's anything else you'd like to test, let me know. Otherwise, let's talk about how we can implement this solution for your business. Implementing a voice AI assistant like the one you just experienced can provide time savings. Automating routine tasks like booking and FAQs means your team can focus on what matters most. Improved customer satisfaction. Customers appreciate instant professional support 24/7. Increased efficiency. Voice AI reduces response times, eliminates missed opportunities, and ensures consistent service. What stood out to you the most during the demonstration? >> Uh, just the conversation itself, really. I didn't realize AI could talk like this. I appreciate that, Dor. Honestly, that's what surprises most people, the natural humanlike conversation. It's designed to make your customers feel heard and taken care of, just like you would. Out of curiosity, when you think about your business, what's your biggest priority if you were to bring in a solution like this? Is it saving time, making things easier for your team, or just making sure your customers get a great experience every time? Honestly, all those things sound good and it almost sounds too good to be true. What I'm afraid of is that it might mess up. And so that's that's really my hesitation. >> Totally get where you're coming from, Dar. It's smart to be cautious. Your reputation's on the line and nobody wants a tech solution that fumbles with real customers. Here's the thing. The system is designed to handle the routine stuff with consistency, but it also knows when to hand things off to a human if something's outside its lane or if a customer needs that personal touch. Plus, you get to customize and test everything before it ever goes live. So, you're always in control. If the AI did make a mistake, what would be the biggest concern for you? Losing a sale, upsetting a customer, or something else? That'll help me show you exactly how we'd address it. >> Yeah. Well, I don't want to give customers the wrong information and upset the customer and certainly don't want to lose a sale as well. >> Makes total sense. Accuracy and customer trust are everything, especially in a business like yours where every order is personal. Here's how we tackle that. You set the guard rails. The AI only gives info you approve. And if a customer asks something it's not sure about, it either escalates to a human or promises a follow-up, never just guesses. That way, you avoid giving out wrong info. And your customers always feel taken care of. And on the sales side, the AI's job is to make it easy for people to order, ask questions, and get what they need, so you're less likely to miss out on business, even after hours. Would it help if you could see exactly how the system handles tricky questions or escalations before you commit? We can walk through those scenarios together, or you can test it out in a real world setting before going allin. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds good. >> Awesome. Based on what we've discussed, the next step is to schedule a one-on-one AI impact assessment with a rep from the BIZ dominance team. In that session, we'll pinpoint where AI can make the biggest difference for Floral Dreams, walk through any scenarios you want to test, and answer all your questions. To make it easy, I'll send you a text so you can pick a time that works best for you. Before I do that, could I get your email address? I'll confirm the spelling before sending anything over. You know what? Uh, Jenna, I'm going to hang up for now. You have done a great job. As a side note, I'm actually recording a demo right now to demonstrate how good you are to the people in YouTube land. That's awesome, Dar. Thanks for letting me be part of your demo and for the kind words. If you need anything else or want to show off more features, just let me know. Have a great one. >> And there you go. All right. Now, pause for a second. That's the moment. That right there is the aha moment for the business owner. Notice what didn't happen. I didn't explain AI. I didn't pitch features. I didn't convince anyone of anything. The prospect experienced it. They heard how natural it sounded. They felt how it handled questions. And now their brain is doing the work for you. They're thinking. They're wondering, "This could actually work. This sounds better than I expected. How would this work in my business? That's when curiosity replaces resistance. And that's why demos like this convert so well. Once someone experiences AI working for them, you don't have to sell it anymore. You just guide them. Now, let me show you how this is actually built. So, I'm inside my highle account. This is a fake account I've set up called demo company. We're going to go to AI agents and we're going to create a new agent. Voice AI agent list and we're going to create an agent from scratch. We're going to hit create custom agent. Continue. Let's give it a name. Let's say Jessica demo company. Now, it's already chosen Jessica as the voice, which by the way is just coincidence. Let me show you how you can find and filter different voice types that you want. So, you can choose the accent you want. I'm going to stick with American for this example, but there's all kinds as you can see. I'm going to choose female and I'm going to go with high quality. And there are different ones that you can choose from. I already have my favorites, but I'll just show you what these some sound like. So essentially, well, what I'm trying to say is that you deserve more. >> Hey, my name is Aaron and this is my natural speaking voice, which is >> they say behind every great man is a great woman, but let's be honest, I'm usually three steps ahead. >> Let's go with Ivana. I'm going to save the voice and then I'm going to paste my initial message down here, which says, "Hi, I'm Jessica, the friendly AI agent at location name." Now, what that is, if you're not familiar, that's called a custom value. So the location name here is demo company. So it'll say hi I'm Jessica the friendly assistant at demo company or if this were bisdominance it would say at bisdom dominance or your company name it would say your company's name. Today I want to show you how I can act as a custom voice AI agent for your business. Can I show you a quick demo? And they're going to say yes. So we're going to go with next. Then what we're going to do is just choose an existing knowledge base and I'm going to switch to advanced mode. Now here in advanced mode, here's where the demo really takes shape and that's in the prompt. So this is a standard prompt from Highle. I'm going to replace it with my demo roleplay prompt. So I'm going to go over here and grab it. Going to grab all this. Select all. You see it all the stuff that creates that prompt and we're going to copy it. Go back all and replace it. All right. So now we have the prompt for the role play the demo. So here's where you would set up your actions. Like if you wanted to trigger a workflow to send a booking link or something like that, you would click new action and you would choose what you would want. Do you want to transfer a call? Do you want to trigger a workflow? Send an SMS? update contact fields, anything like that you want to do appointment booking, you can do. Let's say you want to do appointment booking, you would click that and then choose the calendar. Let's say okay, we'll choose this one. We'll click next. Offer the certain number of dates that you want uh to be available. So, set the number of consecutive days for the agent can suggest dates. Choose the maximum number of slots for each day and set the gap. We'll hit save. And now we've got appointment booking. After the call, let's say that we want to collect some additional information. We'll say new and update contact field. Say first name. First name. And what to update? Um first name of caller. Examples. John Steve, Jill, Amanda. All right. So, now I've given it examples of what first names look like. Let's do another one. Let's go update contact field, last name. And so, what I'm doing is I'm giving it a title here, but then here I'm actually looking for the field, the custom field to update. There it is. And then I'll say what is happening examples. Bill Williams Smith. Save. We'll do also email. So update contact field. email caller's email address examples um Steve1 123gmail.com and we'll do a unique one. Let's do level up at fica. Okay. And so now what we've done is we've triggered custom actions. We've got during the call, appointment booking, after the call, uh, collecting their information and making sure that goes in a contact record. Now, here is where you would choose from a workflow that you would want to send them after the call is completed. For example, for Bis Dominance, I have a workflow that is triggered after the call, about 10 minutes later. it will send a text to the person if they haven't booked a demo yet, like a demo with my company. And so, um, then it will follow up with them. And so, you can do all kinds of things with that. And then if you want to receive emails, uh, if you want to receive an email notification post call completion, in other words, this is going to send an email of the transcript of the demo that just occurred. And you can send it to all admins, all users, uh, a custom email address. So, if you want to click this and type in a custom email like you.com, etc., you can you can do that. We're going to hit next. And now, here is where you're going to attach the phone number to the agent. So, you're going to click and you're going to choose from the numbers that are available in your pool of numbers. So, when you have a highle account, you go to settings and you buy numbers. Numbers are typically $1.50 a month, I think, maybe $2 per month to have your own unique number. You can have as many as you want and you can assign that phone number to this agent. So, this is where you would do that. You can toggle on or off enabling the AI agent as a backup to the phone numbers or just have it answer calls directly. And then you can also set working hours. You can like let it go 24/7 or you can determine the hours that you want it to work. In this case, we're obviously going to let this roleplay agent role play 24/7. And that's that. Now, really quick, this upgrade to unlimited AI employee plan, uh, since this is a demo company I have, I don't have it on the unlimited AI, but on my actual business, Bis Dominance, I do have it on unlimited AI. That way, I only get charged $97 per month, and I can use as much AI as I want. Now, when you're starting out, you might want to choose the pay as you go option with your AI. Uh, and then once you pass $100 in AI usage, then uh, switch over to the unlimited plan. Actually gonna go back into Jessica really quick. There's one other thing I want to show you on the first part of it on the agent details page one. You want to click advanced settings and we're going to choose maximum call time and we're going to up this to the maximum call time which is 15 minutes. The next thing we're going to do is we're going to look at agent behavior. So, I'm going to take this down to moderate speed. And then on the voice settings, I'm going to increase this to 105. Voice temperature. This adjusts the expressiveness and the variability in the voice. And voice volume uh adjusts the volume level of the voice. So, now you've seen the full picture. You understand why this matters. You've experienced the demo the same way a prospect would. and you've seen how it's built behind the scenes.
