I'm about to show you something that is very cool that most people teaching AI agents are not going to show you. Now, the truth is most prospects are curious about AI. They're not resistant. They're not saying no. They're just unsure. And when it comes to AI voice agents, that uncertainty shows up in one place. They don't want to be the first one to talk to it. If you're serious about positioning yourself as an AI agency, not just someone who offers AI, but someone who clearly understands it, you need assets on your website that demonstrate authority, not just explain features. That's what audiograms are designed to do. They don't replace your AI voice demo. They support it. They move prospects through curiosity before you ever ask them to engage. Here's what I see over and over again. A prospect lands on an AI agency website. They see a button to call the AI voice agent or a voice enabled web chat and even though they're interested, they hesitate. Not because they don't believe AI works. Well, maybe they don't quite believe it works yet, but because they don't know what's going to happen when they click. What's it going to say? Am I going to get roped into something? What if it feels awkward? That fear of the unknown is enough to stop their action. And this is where audiograms come in. Watching a video is non-threatening. There's no pressure. No participation is required. Nothing can go wrong. So instead of asking prospects to interact with the AI voice right away, you let them observe it first. They think they're clicking on a video, but what they're actually experiencing is a real roleplay with a real AI voice agent for a business just like theirs. And that's the key. Audiograms aren't generic demos. They answer the unspoken question that every prospect has. How would this work for my business? So, when someone sees a law firm audiogram or a contractor audiogram or a med spa audiogram or a car dealer audiogram, they immediately picture themselves in it. And that moves them one step deeper into curiosity. Oh, this actually makes sense. That sounds natural. I can see this might work for our business. From a positioning standpoint, this does something very powerful. When a prospect sees a nichspecific AI voice example on your site, it signals you've done this before. You understand their industry. You're not just experimenting, but you're actually implementing. And that builds trust. It builds confident. It reinforces authority. And you're no longer explaining AI, you're demonstrating mastery of it. Audiograms don't replace your live AI voice agent. They prepare prospects for it. Once someone has heard an AI voice agent in action, the fear is gone. The mystery is gone. And now clicking the voice widget or calling the AI voice agent to book a demo with you. Well, that feels like the natural next step, not a risky one. I built audiograms for one reason, and that is let prospects move at their pace while still moving forward. they experience AI without the pressure, without the awkwardness, and without commitment for now. For agencies that want to be taken seriously in this space, that matters. Now, we're going to go into my GoHighle account, and I'm going to show you how I build the AI voice agent, how I record the audiograms, how I edit them, and then place them on my site, which is also built in Highle, and how it becomes a simple, reusable authority asset on your website. In this video, I'm going to show you how to make these audiograms like I have here on the Bisdominance website. For example, let's look at this. >> Hi, I'm Ashley, a friendly AI assistant at Creme Chrome. >> So, I'm going to show you how to make these. >> Hi, this is Alex. >> To include the captions as well as the audio wave file. >> Hi, I'm Fiona with Enjoy Optical. How can I help you today? >> Let's get to it. First thing you're going to need to do is sign up for a Google voice number. So, I'm going to call from the Google number here to the number I'm going to demo. Now, I'm in a high level. I'm going to go to my demo account and AI agents. As you can see, I already have some AI agents. I'm going to choose this one, which is Ali. Ali's the one that I've been using for demos. This is the demo that I did for Porsche Oklahoma City. And I'm going to verify that it is still accurate. So, I'm going to go to aging goals. I'm going to look at the prompts. And yep, sure enough, Oklahoma City Porsche. Quick side note, when you use the prompt builder that builds the prompt for your business, for a local business, for any business, you need to test it. And when you test it, you'll notice things that you want to make an adjustment to. So, for example, when I called this voice AI agent that I had built for Porsche Oklahoma City, and I started asking it about the cars like the 911 and the 718. Well, in the prompt I had 911 and the voice AI agent said 911 and 718. Obviously, the cars are not referred to like that. They're referred to as a 911 and a 718. So, after testing it, I just came into the prompt and I made this instruction. When referring to the vehicle model names that have numbers in the name, they are pronounced as follows. Example, model 911 is pronounced 911. The model 718 is pronounced 718. I show you this to show you an example of how you would simply go into a prompt and make an adjustment after testing it. Okay, now back to it. So, this is right. This is the prompt for Porsche only city and I have it attached to this number. Now, I'm going to call this number from the Google phone. Now, before I call, I'm going to go to Riverside FM, which is where I do my recordings. So, I'm going to start a new project and do record. Uh, not using headphones. Let's go. Now, I'm going to share my screen. I'm going to choose screen and I'm going to choose the Google voice. And if you'll notice right here, this is the secret sauce. Also, share tab audio. If you don't allow your recording device to share the tab audio, then you're not going to get good, clear audio. So, I'm going to do share. And once I click record and it starts recording, then I'm going to make my call. >> Thank you for calling Porsche, Oklahoma City. This is Ally. How can I assist you today? >> Hey, Ally. Yeah, I am um I'm looking for a used late model Porsche 911. Do you all have any? >> Great choice. Let me check on that for you. Could I get your first and last name, please? >> Steve Jones. >> Thanks, Steve. Just to confirm, your name is S T E V E J O N E S. >> Yes. >> Perfect, Steve. Now, let me check our inventory for a late model Porsche 911. One moment. It looks like we do have some pre-owned Porsche 911s available. Would you like to schedule a test drive or consultation to see them in person? >> Yeah, that'd be great. >> Awesome. To make scheduling easier, I'll send you a text message so you can book an appointment at your convenience. Could I have your email address to send the link? >> Stevejones.com. >> Thanks, Steve. Just to confirm, your email is s e v j o neest.com. >> Yes. >> Great. I'll send you a text message with the link to schedule your appointment. Just pick a day and time that works best for you. Let me know once you've got it scheduled. >> Okay, great. >> Thank you for calling Porsche, Oklahoma City, Steve. Keep an eye on your phone for a message from our team. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reply to the message. Have a great day. >> Thanks. You too. Bye. Okay, now I have recorded the call. I'm going to view my recording. And it's processing. Once it's done processing, we'll come back to it. Now, I'm going to edit it. >> Thank you for calling Porsche Oklahoma City. This is Ally. How can I assist you today? Once Riverside is finished rendering the file, then I go through and make my edits. Now that I've made the edits, I'm going to download the file. Once the file has been exported, I'm going to download it. And now I am in Dscript. So Dcript is another editing program. I'm going to go with a new project. We're going to call it a video project. I'm going to upload the file right here. AI Porsche. Now I've got the transcript. Choose my AI avatar. Okay, I'm going to stop it at kind of a high point because now I'm going to do captions, which is this one. Move this up here. Okay. Now, here is where we're going to make edits. Now, I'm going to go through all of the captions and make adjustments. So, for example, let's look at this. I'm going to space these out. So, now I've run through all of the captions, corrected them the way I want them to present, and I'm going to export this file, and I'm going to download it. And then here is the finished file. >> Thank you for calling Porsche, Oklahoma City. This is Ally. How can I assist you today? >> Hey, Ally. Yeah, I'm looking for a used late model Porsche 911. Do you all have any? >> Great choice. Let me check on that for you. Could I get your first and last name, please? >> Steve Jones. >> Thanks, Steve. Just to confirm, your name is S T V E J O N E S. >> Yes. >> Perfect. Steve, now let me check our inventory for a late model Porsche 911. One moment. It looks like we do have some pre-owned Porsche 911s available. Would you like to schedule a test drive or consultation to see them in person? >> Yeah, that'd be great. >> Now, I'm going to go into the SAS site, edit the homepage, and if you've received the template from me, then you just have these as images, not as videos. So, we're going to come in here. We're going to going to change this to a video. Select video. Then we're going to choose hosted video and select the video file Porsche Wave. Then we're going to select the thumbnail. So we change this to we're going to hit save and we're going to take a look at it. Scroll down and here we go. >> Goody. This is Ally. If you'll notice, it started autoplaying. So, we're going to go back on this video and we will turn autoplay off. Save it again. And here we go. >> Thank you for calling Porsche Oklahoma City. This is Ally. How can I assist you today? >> Hey, Ally. Yeah, I'm looking for a used late model Porsche 911. Do you all have any? >> Great choice. >> And that's how you do it. Hope this video was helpful. We'll see you down the road. AI voice is still early. Most businesses have not experienced it like this yet. The agencies that win won't be the loudest. They'll be the ones who guide prospects through curiosity with confidence. Audiograms are one of the simplest ways to do that.
