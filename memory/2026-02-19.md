- Mandate: stop tinkering, start marketing — get Human Led AI visible

## 8:46 PM — Dashboard Upgrade Discussion
- Jay sent article about building a "Mission Control" dashboard for OpenClaw
- Article by Alex Finn describes: Tasks Board, Content Pipeline, Calendar, Memory Viewer, Team Screen, Office View
- Built with NextJS + Convex database
- Jay wants to improve our existing dashboard — "it kind of makes me sad"
- Current dashboard is basic; article shows what's possible
- We already have bones: ACTIVE-TASKS.md, memory/ folder, Bridge API, team concept (Prime + VC)
- Discussed which screens to prioritize for our setup
- Action: Draft updated dashboard spec incorporating these ideas

## 9:00 PM — Dashboard V3 War Room Spec Written
- Jay gave detailed vision for each screen — quoted directly in spec
- **Projects Board**: Kanban (On Deck / In Progress / Waiting For), each card has PRD + Goals + Steps to Finish
- **Content Pipeline**: ALL platforms listed (12+) whether account exists or not. Sub-agents can be devoted 24/7
- **Round Table**: Jay + Prime + VC + future agents at a table. Agents CAN talk to each other. Jay can override. "Stop horsing around and get to work"
- **Memory Viewer & Manager**: File tree, viewer/editor, real-time activity stream, search, health dashboard
- **Office View**: Overseer above worker bees. Bird's-eye of all agents and their status
- **Calendar**: Auto-populated from crons, heartbeats, content due dates, project deadlines
- Spec written: `DASHBOARD-V3.md` (548 lines, 19KB)
- Pushed to shared-brain repo: commit `f8ead53`
- Tech recommendation: Use Supabase Realtime instead of adding Convex (we already have Supabase)
- Supabase tables designed: projects, content_items, platforms, calendar_events, agent_messages
- VC had pushed something to repo (had to rebase before push)
- Decision: V3 supersedes V2. V2 endpoints remain valid.

## 9:25 PM — Dashboard V3 Build Started
- Jay said BUILD IT, don't wait for VC
- Discussed Prime↔VC communication: currently git-based only (no direct messaging)
- Jay's key concern: "I don't want you guys talking about me behind my back" — ALL agent-to-agent comms must be visible
- Decision: Supabase `agent_messages` table = the pipe. Dashboard Round Table = Jay's window. Nothing hidden.
- Jay's add-ons: Live Task tracker, Goals Board with dates/progress, Recording Feed in the corner, "Hey You" dropdown on every screen
- Built Next.js 14 app at `/home/plotting1/mission-control-v3/`
- Stack: Next.js + Tailwind + Supabase JS client
- Created: Sidebar, TopBar, HeyYouBar, Office screen with 4 widgets (AgentCards, LiveTasks, GoalsBoard, RecordingFeed, ActivityFeed)
- Placeholder pages for all 7 screens (navigation works)
- Build: CLEAN — zero errors, all 11 routes generated
- Running on port 3333 — returns 200
- SQL migration file: `supabase-setup.sql` — needs to be run in Supabase SQL Editor (no CLI access token)
- BLOCKER CLEARED: Jay ran SQL in Supabase dashboard — all 6 tables created, realtime enabled, 5 projects + 12 platforms seeded
- Built Projects Board: Kanban with 3 columns (In Progress / Waiting For / On Deck), expandable cards with PRD/goals/steps, live Supabase data, realtime subscriptions
- Built Round Table: Visual table with Jay/Prime/VC seats, real-time chat via Supabase Realtime, quick command buttons, Bridge API relay on send
- Static export built (1.6MB), copied to FRANKIES_Mission_Control/dashboard/, pushed to GitHub (commit 5fd253a)
- Netlify auto-deploy triggered — should be live at frankiesmissioncontrol.netlify.app
- Old dashboard backed up as dashboard-v2-backup/
- Waiting on Jay to check live site and give feedback

## Research Notes
- Reddit post on OpenClaw memory: structure matters more than embedding quality
- 82% recall achieved by reorganizing files, not upgrading embeddings
- One topic per file, QMD backend >> builtin
- OpenClaw has built-in memoryFlush: silent turn before compaction forces memory write
- Heartbeat config: every 30m, customizable prompt, activeHours support
- Decision: Need to restructure memory/ folder (split TOOLS.md, add people/ projects/ reference/ subfolders)
- Decision: Enable memoryFlush in compaction config
- Action needed: Run OpenClaw update first, then restructure
