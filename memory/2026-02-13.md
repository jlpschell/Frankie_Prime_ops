# Daily Log — 2026-02-13

- [19:24] Phase 0.1 COMPLETE — Supabase cleaned: 17 memories (purged 56 → 0 → re-seeded 17), library table created (Jay ran SQL in editor), threshold already at 0.35. All 3 tests pass.
- [19:30] Phase 0.2 COMPLETE (code) — claude-bridge.ts loads SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, daily logs into Telegram prompt with XML tags. Context logging + token budget. Confirmed in logs: SOUL.md ✅, MEMORY.md ✅. Fixed Central Time date calculation. Telegram tests pending restart.
- [20:45] Phase 0.3 COMPLETE (code) — Session history already wired: getHistory() → buildPrompt(), addMessage() stores exchanges, log line added. Telegram test pending.
- [20:50] Phase 0.4 COMPLETE (code) — Upgraded extractAndStoreMemory from regex to Claude CLI extraction. Extracts clean facts as JSON, stores to Supabase + appends to daily log. Biscuit test pending restart.
- [20:55] Phase 0.6 COMPLETE (code) — Disabled startDriveSync() in relay.ts. Was spamming 403 every 5 min. Will re-enable after auth consolidation (0.5).

- [21:38] Memory extracted:
- [memory] Jay's brother's name is Ryan
