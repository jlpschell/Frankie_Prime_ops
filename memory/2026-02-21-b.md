# Daily Log — 2026-02-21 (Afternoon Session)

## 12:04 PM — Security Incident: Exposed API Keys
- Google flagged Gemini API key exposed in public GitHub repo
- Discovered ALL 8+ repos under jlpschell were PUBLIC
- Keys exposed: Gemini (x3), OpenAI, Supabase service role, GHL PIT, GitHub PAT, bridge tokens
- Actions taken:
  - Scrubbed all API keys from every .md file across workspace
  - Deleted backups/ folder (contained raw keys)
  - Purged git history with git-filter-repo
  - Added comprehensive .gitignore to all 4 local repos
  - Removed PAT from git remote URLs
  - Force-pushed clean history
- Jay made ALL repos private — confirmed zero visitors
- Gave Jay rotation checklist for all exposed keys
- Decisions: Since zero visitors, rotation is good hygiene not emergency

## 12:30 PM — Obsidian Integration
- Installed obsidian-cli via npm (needed symlink: binary registers as 'obsidian' not 'obsidian-cli')
- Obsidian skill now shows ✓ ready in OpenClaw
- Jay installed Obsidian desktop + Local REST API plugin
- REST API can't connect from WSL (network boundary) — but direct file access works
- Vault created at C:\Users\Jay\OneDrive\Desktop\Future_US
- Seeded vault with starter notes: Home dashboard, Human Led AI, Jay Schell, Frankie System, Revenue Streams, GHL Integration, Daily template
- All notes use [[wiki links]] for graph view

## 12:45 PM — Obsidian Sync Discussion
- Jay wants phone + desktop sync without paying for Obsidian Sync ($8/mo)
- OneDrive folder exists and vault is already in it
- Problem: Obsidian iOS can't read OneDrive natively
- Recommended: iCloud Drive (only native iOS Obsidian sync option)
- Pending: Jay needs iCloud for Windows installed to make this work

## Pending
- Jay needs to rotate exposed API keys (checklist provided)
- Obsidian vault sync to iPhone — waiting on iCloud for Windows setup
- Install ffmpeg (done), transcribed Jay's video message via Whisper API
