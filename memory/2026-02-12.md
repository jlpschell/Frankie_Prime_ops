# Daily Log — 2026-02-12

## Session: Architecture Planning & Baseline Setup

### What Happened
- CLAUDE.md was overwritten with Workflow Conversion Agent instructions — restored from .backup
- Git initialized with .gitignore (excludes .env, node_modules, credentials, drive_sync, jay/, venv)
- Baseline commit created: `39f7264` — "Frankie 2.1 - baseline before architecture upgrade"
- Memory layer created: SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, this daily log

### Knowledge Folder Status
Already populated from previous sessions:
- `ghl_reference.md` — GoHighLevel CRM reference (AI Employee, Voice AI, workflows)
- `notebooklm_index.md` — 75+ notebooks indexed from Google Takeout
- `youtube_index.md` — ~97,000 lines of watch history analyzed
- `quantcrawler_ghost_reference.md` — Trading platform reference (QuantCrawler + Ghost)

### Issues Encountered
- `workspace/drive_sync/takeout/` too large for git — added to .gitignore
- Python venv symlinks in `workspace/jay/` broke git add — excluded `workspace/jay/` from git
- CRLF warnings on hundreds of files (Windows/WSL cross-filesystem)

### Next Steps
- ~~Skill consolidation (core/build/agents tiers)~~ DONE
- ~~Skill index with trigger-based auto-discovery~~ DONE
- ~~Windows portal setup~~ DONE
- Wire skill index into claude-bridge.ts prompt builder
- Add heartbeat scheduler (cron or interval)
- Test Frankie restart with new CLAUDE.md personality

## Compound Learnings

### What Was Built
1. **Git baseline** — commit `39f7264` (all existing code preserved)
2. **Memory layer** — SOUL.md (identity), MEMORY.md (facts), HEARTBEAT.md (monitoring), daily logs
3. **Windows portal** — bidirectional file bridge at `/mnt/c/Users/Jay/Desktop/Frankie-Portal`
4. **Skill consolidation** — 44 skills organized into 3 tiers
5. **Skill index** — `index.json` with trigger-keyword auto-discovery (23 entries mapped)

### Errors Encountered & Resolutions
| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `git add` fatal: Function not implemented | Python venv symlinks in `workspace/jay/` | Added `workspace/jay/` to .gitignore |
| `git add` timeout on staging | `workspace/drive_sync/takeout/` has thousands of files | Added `workspace/drive_sync/` to .gitignore |
| Dubious ownership warning | Windows/WSL cross-filesystem git | `git config --global --add safe.directory` |
| CRLF warnings (hundreds) | Windows line endings in WSL files | Non-blocking — just warnings |

### File Counts by Tier
- **Core skills:** 9 (copywriting, trading, ghl-mastery, brand-identity, frankie-voice, skill-factory, writing-skills, brainstorming, seo-fundamentals)
- **Build skills:** 26 (frontend-design, api-patterns, python-patterns, mcp-builder, app-builder, database-design, react-patterns, nextjs, nodejs, tailwind, testing, clean-code, systematic-debugging, server-management, deployment, bash-linux, game-dev, mobile, geo, perf-profiling, vuln-scanner, webapp-testing, red-team, lint-validate, configure-brave-api, documentation-templates)
- **Agent skills:** 9 (parallel-agents, subagent-driven-dev, intelligent-routing, executing-plans, verification, step-by-step-guide, behavioral-modes, using-superpowers, dispatching-parallel-agents)

### Component Status
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Git repo | DONE — 4 commits |
| CLAUDE.md (personality) | DONE — restored from backup |
| SOUL.md | DONE — full identity |
| MEMORY.md | DONE — curated facts |
| HEARTBEAT.md | DONE — monitoring rules |
| Daily logs | DONE — workspace/memory/ |
| Windows portal | DONE — symlinked |
| Skill consolidation | DONE — 3 tiers |
| Skill index | DONE — 23 triggers mapped |
| Heartbeat scheduler | BLOCKED — needs cron/interval wiring |
| Skill auto-loading in prompt | BLOCKED — needs claude-bridge.ts changes |
