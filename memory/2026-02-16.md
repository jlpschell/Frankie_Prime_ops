# Daily Log — 2026-02-16

## [Prime] Late Night Work Session (~10 PM - 11:20 PM)

### Lead Pipeline — MAJOR PROGRESS
- Processed 12 Outscraper exports across niches: roofers, GC, concrete, HVAC, electricians, fence, landscaping, plumbers, pest control, garage door, medspas, attorneys
- Discovered 9/12 exports already had carrier_type from Outscraper enrichment — saved $11+ in Twilio lookup costs
- Extracted 519 mobile-verified leads
- Uploaded all 519 to GHL with tags:
  - `{niche}_{date}` (e.g. roofers_02-16-26)
  - `mobile-verified`
  - `cold-outreach`
  - `voice-eric` or `voice-chris`
  - `load-02-16-26`
- Final GHL count: 738 total contacts (248 new creates + 271 existing tagged)
- Pest control: only 1 mobile out of 76 — moved to email-only campaign list
- Massage spa file still processing in Outscraper (not received yet)

- Audio rendering of 27 VM scripts via ElevenLabs (not started)
