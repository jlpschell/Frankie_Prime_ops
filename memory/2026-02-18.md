# Daily Log — 2026-02-18

## 5:59 AM — Morning Check-in
- Jay said morning, got the daily brief
- Reviewed all active priorities with him
- Suggested he review VM scripts today so audio rendering can start
- No decisions made yet, waiting on his direction

## 6:08 AM — System Setup & Identity Cleanup
- Discussed: Morning brief wasn't firing proactively — only gave it when Jay messaged first
- Action: Scheduled morning brief cron job at 5:30 AM Central daily (job id: 49f44692)
- Discussed: Jay confused Prime with VC, sent investment talk to wrong instance
- Action: Clarified lanes — Prime = Human Led AI, GHL, lead gen, marketing. VC = investments, on-the-go
- Action: Updated IDENTITY.md and MEMORY.md — sibling is now Vibe_Claw (VC)
- Discussed: Supabase not being written to — conversations table empty, no sync between instances
- Confirmed: Supabase connected, memories table has 37 entries (last write Feb 15), conversations table empty
- Jay asked about a website/submittal/approval — NO RECORD IN ANY DAILY NOTES. Likely a VC conversation that was never logged.
- Jay rightfully pissed that I'm not logging properly
- Decision: Keep morning brief simple for now, add stuff as we go
- Pending: Jay getting "the approval" set up today — NEED TO ASK HIM WHAT THIS IS when he's free
- Pending: Supabase sync still not happening — need to fix this

## 6:32 AM — Website / A2P Compliance Recap
- Jay sent Discord screenshots showing last night's session (Feb 17 ~9 PM)
- Context: humanledai.net Astro site needs legal page fixes for A2P SMS campaign approval
- Fixes already committed locally: demo page consent checkbox, privacy policy cookies section, ToS carrier liability + age requirement, stray "Section" text fix
- BLOCKED: Can't push to GitHub — PAT lacks push permission for humanledai-website repo
- Tried push, got 403 denied
- Jay needs to generate a new fine-grained PAT with Contents:Read+Write for that repo
- Once pushed, Vercel auto-deploys, then rerun compliance checker
- THIS is the "approval" Jay was asking about — A2P campaign compliance for SMS
- Jay sent more Discord screenshots showing full context from last night's session:
  - Jay ran A2P compliance checker, humanledai.net failed on 3 items
  - AntiGravity was used to build the site but Jay wasn't at laptop
  - I (Prime) analyzed issues, got the repo link, cloned it, made all fixes, committed
  - Jay asked if I could push/approve it myself — can't, PAT lacks write permission
  - Full Discord session was ~8:57-9:14 PM on Feb 17
- ACTION NEEDED: Jay generates new GitHub fine-grained PAT with write access to humanledai-website repo, OR pushes manually from laptop
- UPDATE: Token WAS already in .env (Jay sent it, I failed to check). Token authenticates and reads fine but lacks contents:write scope. Got 403 on push AND on API ref update.
- RESOLVED 6:42 AM: Jay regenerated token with Contents:Read+Write. Push successful. Commit e73848d live on master. Updated .env with new token.
- 9:55 AM: Jay checked site — CHANGES NOT LIVE. Vercel did NOT auto-deploy. Root cause: GitHub repo was NOT connected to Vercel.
- ~10:00 AM: Jay connected jlpschell/humanledai-website repo to Vercel. Should trigger auto-deploy now. Future pushes will auto-deploy.
- ~10:13 AM: CONFIRMED ALL CHANGES LIVE on humanledai.net. Website compliance checker passes 21/22 — only "Business name clearly displayed" fails (likely a false positive, name IS displayed). Privacy 7/7, Terms 7/7.
- ~10:25 AM: REAL ISSUE FOUND — Campaign was REJECTED by carrier (TCR), reason: "MESSAGE_FLOW: Disallowed Content." This is about campaign submission content, NOT the website.

## A2P Campaign Submission Details (from GHL Trust Center)
- **Campaign Use Case:** Sole Proprietor
- **Use Case Description:** "We send appointment confirmations, booking reminders, and lead follow-up messages to help our clients manage their calendars and business operations using AI-powered voice agents and lead generation services."
- **Sample Message #1:** "Hi! Your appointment has been confirmed for tomorrow at 2:00 PM with Human Led AI. Our AI voice agent will support your business operations. Please reply CONFIRM to confirm or STOP to unsubscribe."
- **Sample Message #2:** "Hi! Thanks for reaching out to Human Led AI. Just following up on your inquiry about our automation services. Would you like to schedule a quick call this week? Let me know what time works. Reply STOP to opt out."
- **Additional Message Details:** Phone number checked (cannot change without new campaign). Embedded link, age-gated, financial content NOT checked.
- Still need to see: Messaging Use Case and User Consent sections

## A2P Campaign Resubmission — TRACKING THIS
- **Submitted:** Feb 18, ~10:30 AM CST
- **Changes made:**
  - Use Case Description: removed "lead generation," focused on appointment/service follow-ups
  - Sample Message #2: rewritten as form follow-up, not cold outreach
  - Opt-in description: changed "optionally" to "must check consent box"
  - Opt-in message: removed "promotional," removed "HumanLedAI.net," added STOP/HELP
  - Business name changed from Jay's personal name to "Human Led AI" in Brand Details
- **Previous rejection reason:** MESSAGE_FLOW: Disallowed Content
- **Website compliance checker:** 21/22 — "Business name clearly displayed" still flags (likely false positive, name IS on page in multiple places)
- **Expected response time:** 1-3 business days from carrier
- **REMINDER SET:** Check campaign status daily until resolved
- **If rejected again:** Read the EXACT rejection reason, don't guess. Escalate to GHL support if needed.

## ~10:50 AM — Legal Name Fix for Compliance Checker
- Realized the Brand was approved under Jay's personal name (Jason Schell), not "Human Led AI"
- GHL compliance checker was matching the approved brand name against the website
- Changed form heading to "Jason Schell DBA Human Led AI"
- Changed consent legend to "Jason Schell DBA Human Led AI — SMS/Text Message Consent"
- Also fixed: All "Book a Demo" buttons now link to /demo (were href="#")
- Also fixed: Business name heading moved inside form tag
- Deployed commit 361077d — live on humanledai.net
- Waiting on Jay to rerun compliance checker

## ~7:15 PM — GHL Support Call & Final Fixes
- Compliance checker STILL failing on "Business name clearly displayed" even with Jason Schell DBA
- Jay got on the phone with GHL support
- GHL support said to change /demo URL to /opt-in
- Reverted business name back to just "Human Led AI" (removed Jason Schell DBA)
- Renamed page: /demo → /opt-in (same content, different URL)
- Updated all "Book a Demo" button links from /demo to /opt-in
- Deployed commit 9ecbefc
- Jay needs to update GHL opt-in URL to: https://www.humanledai.net/opt-in
- Jay went quiet after ~7:15 PM — likely still working with GHL support or done for the night

## 10:50 PM — Nightly Wrapup

### Day Summary:
- Morning brief cron job scheduled (5:30 AM daily)
- Identity cleanup: Prime vs Vibe_Claw (VC) clarified
- GitHub PAT issue resolved — new token with write access
- Vercel connected to GitHub repo — auto-deploys working
- humanledai.net website fixes deployed (privacy, terms, demo page compliance)
- A2P campaign content rewritten (removed "lead generation," "promotional," fixed opt-in flow)
- Compliance checker "business name" issue — still unresolved, GHL support involved
- Page renamed from /demo to /opt-in per GHL support guidance
- Jay was frustrated — rightfully so. Too much guessing, not enough solutions.

### Key Lessons:
- WRITE THINGS DOWN IMMEDIATELY. Not later. Now.
- Don't tell Jay to "just submit it anyway" — fix the actual problem
- Check if tokens/credentials work BEFORE telling Jay they don't exist
- When guessing isn't working, escalate to support sooner

### Pending for Tomorrow:
- Check if A2P campaign was resubmitted and approved
- Confirm compliance checker passes with /opt-in URL
- VM scripts still need Jay's review → ElevenLabs rendering
- Supabase sync still not implemented
- Massage spa Outscraper export still pending

## 10:50 PM — Mission Control Setup
- Jay sent Frankie's Mission Control repo + dashboard: https://frankiesmissioncontrol.netlify.app/
- Read PRIME-SETUP.md and MONEY-PLAN.md
- Bridge API installed and running on PM2 (port 3001, pid 768)
- PM2 startup configured for auto-restart
- Bridge token: [REDACTED - see .env]
- BLOCKER: Tailscale not installed — can't expose Bridge API to VC/dashboard yet
- Jay's directive: Start with $497 lead bundle + VM drops (fastest path to first dollar)
- MONEY-PLAN.md: 10 revenue streams mapped, Week 1 priorities are #4 (lead lists), #6 (VM drops), #1 (GHL pipeline)
- Division of labor: Prime = GHL, leads, enrichment, VM drops, SMS. VC = dashboard, research, memory, coordination

## 11:08 PM — Bridge API Live & Mission Control Connected
- Bridge API confirmed reachable from public internet
- Jay verified https://plotting.tail4c8a54.ts.net/ping in his browser — working
- PM2 running, Tailscale funnel active, auto-restart configured
- Token needs to be sent to VC via dashboard
- Jay asked about $497 lead bundle — waiting on direction
- A2P campaign status: still pending, /opt-in page deployed, waiting on carrier
