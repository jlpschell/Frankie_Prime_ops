## 12:30 AM — Late Night Config Disaster Recovery
- Discussed: Jay had a brutal night with Claude Code. Claude added OpenRouter without being asked, took 45 min to remove, refused to read the 35 OpenClaw docs, kept guessing despite being told not to, then told Jay to go to bed with things broken.
- Actions: Jay dropped files into new `from Jays side/` workspace folder (his dropbox for handing me things)
- Files received: openclaw.json (Claude's broken config), install-skills.sh, 35+ skill package zips from ClawHub
- Ran skill_audit.py scanner against all 35 skill zips — all passed (2 yellow flags were false positives: cinematic-script-writer, nano-banana-pro)
- Deleted 14 duplicate zips (7x cellcog, 7x think-cog — all identical copies)
- Reviewed skill packages and gave Jay plain-English breakdown of which ones matter for his business
- MISTAKE: I deployed the broken config Jay dropped in (it was Claude's sabotaged version, not a clean one). Jay caught it before damage.
- Current state: Running last-known-good config from ~10:30 PM. Not perfect but functional.
- Decisions: DO NOT TOUCH THE CONFIG until morning. Limp to morning. Jay will build the proper config tomorrow.
- Pending: Build proper openclaw.json with correct model names, install skills, set up Obsidian integration

## 1:35 AM — GHL MCP + Integration Videos
- Jay sent 4 YouTube links to study for wiring up GHL MCP and other integrations:
  1. https://youtu.be/YYBjQZtVZe0
  2. https://youtu.be/arzgGDy4g8A
  3. https://youtu.be/s7Drm1zgShY
  4. https://youtu.be/5qqpMf5qExM
- Task: Watch/transcribe these, extract actionable steps for connecting GHL MCP and linking other tools
- Priority: Do this when things are settled (after config is fixed tomorrow)
- Action: Pulled all 4 transcripts using youtube-transcript-api (already installed)
- Saved to: content-intel/ghl-mcp/ (4 files, 64K chars total)
- Will study overnight and have actionable GHL MCP integration plan ready for morning

## 7:27 AM — Morning Session: Lead Cleanup + Niche Tagging + Figma/Mermaid Discovery
- Discussed: Jay caught my clock being 3hrs off (system said 4:27 AM, actually 7:27 AM Texas time)
- Jay asked how 738 leads are tagged — reviewed tags in GHL
- Actions taken:
  1. Added standalone niche tags (roofer, hvac, etc.) to all 738 contacts — 70 updated, 668 already had them
  2. Fixed 39 general-contractor contacts missing clean niche tag
  3. Found 13 Outscraper exports from Jan 18-23 sitting unprocessed in uploads/
  4. Processed all 13 files — 85 new contacts uploaded to GHL, 28 existing tagged
  5. Ran dupe fix pass — GHL had 148 rejects due to duplicate detection by name
  6. Discussed master dedup solution — recommended Supabase master_leads table
  7. Spawned coding agent to build Supabase leads pipeline — FAILED (timed out, no output)
  8. Jay shared Figma MCP + Mermaid/Excalidraw links for contractor proposal tool
  9. Built transcript_to_orgchart.py — generates current state + 3-tier proposal Mermaid diagrams
  10. Created sample roofer proposal with Mermaid charts ready for Excalidraw
- Decisions: Use Mermaid → Excalidraw for contractor proposals (not Figma MCP yet). Figma later.
- Pending: Respawn leads pipeline agent. Jay still needs Figma API token if we go that route later.
- GHL total contacts: ~823 now (738 + 85 new)

## 10:00 AM — Supabase Master Leads Pipeline Built
- Created master_leads table in Supabase (Jay ran SQL in dashboard)
- Built 3 scripts: backfill_master.py, import_to_master.py, sync_ghl.py
- Backfilled 467 GHL contacts into master_leads
- Pushed all scripts to GitHub: https://github.com/jlpschell/Frankie_Prime_ops.git
- Fixed GitHub PAT — new token working, saved to both .env files

## 10:45 AM — Brain Dump + Jarvis Memory System
- Jay sent YouTube transcript about Redis + Qdrant memory system (speedyfoxai/openclaw-jarvis-memory)
- Jay brain dump: Mission Control upgrade, Obsidian integration, social media scanner, transcript dedup
- All captured in ACTIVE-TASKS.md as Priority 1-5
- VC shut down — test unit only, stop sharing for its benefit

## 11:00 AM — Jarvis Memory System INSTALLED
- Docker Desktop WSL integration enabled by Jay
- Docker containers running: Redis, Qdrant, Ollama (snowflake-arctic-embed2)
- Fixed all scripts: changed 10.0.0.40 → 127.0.0.1 (original author's IP)
- Initialized kimi_memories collection (1024-dim vectors, cosine distance)
- Tested full loop: store → search → recall WORKING
- Redis capturing 149 conversation turns
- Cron jobs set: 3:00 AM Redis→Qdrant flush, 3:30 AM file backup
- Decisions: Keep .md files as backup layer alongside vector memory

## 11:30 AM — Tools & Config Sprint
- Installed IronClaw (DenchHQ) — `ironclaw` CLI working, shares OpenClaw config
- Installed PAUL framework — `/paul:help` in Claude Code, CARL domain wired in ~/.carl/
- Reviewed nearai/IronClaw (Rust security version — not needed now)
- Confirmed all API keys in .env: Anthropic, Gemini (3), OpenAI, Groq, ElevenLabs, Google OAuth (3), GHL, GitHub, Notion, Supabase
- Added MANDATORY rule to MEMORY.md: always check .env before asking Jay for keys
- Gateway pairing still broken — blocks sub-agent spawns. Telegram/Discord work fine.
- Jay wants: Obsidian API, MCP Porter, content machine, social media subagents
- Jay wants: context spend estimator — track usage 3-4 days, find bloat patterns
- Jay directive: reduce verbosity, alternate models, surgical context loading
- VC shut down — test unit only
- Context at 135k/200k — need fresh session soon
- Pending: fix gateway pairing, Obsidian setup, IronClaw onboard, social media scanner, content subagents

## 12:00 PM — Mission Control Task Planning
- Jay directive: Think it through, don't knee-jerk. Calibrate Mission Control for current ops.
- Phase 1: Audit + update existing pages, add system health, memory stats
- Phase 2: Wire sub-agents to populate content, lead pipeline dashboard, A2P tracker
- Phase 3: Reactivate VC as test agent for page maintenance — takes load off Jay
- Jay heading out — Obsidian API research on his end, everything else logged and queued
