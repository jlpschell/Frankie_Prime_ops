# Daily Log — 2026-02-21

## 12:00 PM — Security Incident: Public GitHub Repos with Exposed API Keys
- Discovered: ALL 8+ GitHub repos were PUBLIC
- Exposed keys: GHL PIT, Gemini (x3), OpenAI, Supabase service role, GitHub PAT, bridge tokens
- Actions: Scrubbed all keys from all .md files, purged git history (git-filter-repo), force-pushed, added .gitignore to all repos, removed PAT from remote URLs
- Jay made all repos private manually — confirmed zero visitors
- Pending: Key rotation checklist given to Jay (Gemini, OpenAI, GHL, Supabase service role, GitHub PAT)

## 12:15 PM — Obsidian Integration
- Installed obsidian-cli via npm (needed symlink: binary registers as 'obsidian' not 'obsidian-cli')
- Skill now shows ✓ ready in OpenClaw
- Jay created vault "Future_US" on Windows desktop
- Vault moved to OneDrive: C:\Users\Jay\OneDrive\Desktop\Future_US
- Seeded vault with starter notes: Home, Human Led AI, Jay Schell, Frankie System, Revenue Streams, GHL Integration, Daily template
- Created Remotely Save setup guide for iPhone sync (in Guides folder)
- REST API plugin installed (key in .env) but not needed — WSL can write directly to vault via /mnt/c/

## 12:08 PM — Heartbeat (skipped — active security incident)

## 12:45 PM — Transcription Capability Added
- Installed ffmpeg for audio extraction
- Successfully transcribed Jay's video message using OpenAI Whisper API
- Can now process voice/video messages

## 1:00 PM — Content Machine Architecture Designed
- Jay requested full content pipeline with sub-agents for humanledai.net
- Focus: AI news that affects businesses and individuals
- Designed 5-agent system: SCOUT (scrape), MINER (aggregate), FORGE (write), BLAST (distribute), GUARD (QA)
- All agent task files written with detailed instructions
- Config files: sources.json, brand-voice.md
- Estimated cost: ~$0.53/day ($16/month)
- Phase 1: Content staged for Jay's approval (no auto-posting)

## 1:15 PM — Fiverr Gig Agents Designed
- Jay wants Fiverr/Upwork gig fulfillment agents running parallel to content machine
- 6 Fiverr agents built: SCRIBE ($75-150), HUNTER ($100-200), BLOGGER ($150-300), INTEL ($200-500), DIRECTOR ($75-150), PLANNER ($75-150)
- All task files written in content-machine/agents/fiverr/
- 95%+ profit margins — AI cost is pennies per gig
- AGENT-ROSTER.md created with full spawn commands

## 1:30 PM — YouTube Transcript Scraper Confirmed Working
- youtube-transcript-api already installed (Python) — I didn't check inventory first, Jay called me out
- Tested on Ray's Orgo.ai livestream (4KxXUVtorWk) — 71K chars pulled successfully
- Transcript saved to content-machine/inbox/ and Obsidian vault
- Key takeaway from video: sub-agent parallelization pattern — we're already doing this
- Jay pointed out I keep looking for new tools when they're already installed — PATTERN. 7 times in 2 days.
- Built INVENTORY.md (227 lines) — full catalog of every package, script, service, binary
- Added mandatory "check INVENTORY.md before building anything" rule to MEMORY.md

## 1:45 PM — Two-Machine Architecture Decision
- Jay wants Vivobook (VC) as a sub-orchestrator under Prime
- Clear hierarchy: Jay (CEO) → Prime (COO, Dell) → VC (Ops Manager, Vivobook)
- Supabase task_queue table for coordination — no more fighting over resources
- Both machines share Supabase brain but have clear roles
- VC executes delegated work, reports to Prime, not directly to Jay

## 2:00 PM — PRD Written for External Analysis
- Jay wants Claude to analyze the full plan for blind spots
- Complete PRD written: 15K chars covering all 13 agents, architecture, Supabase schema, security, revenue projections, risks, 10 open questions
- Saved to workspace + Obsidian vault
- Jay to feed it to Claude.ai for ruthless analysis

## 2:15 PM — Standing Order from Jay
- Decision: ALWAYS update daily log immediately when things happen
- Never make judgment calls on what's "worth" logging
- Everything gets written, every time, no exceptions

## 3:00 PM — Claude PRD Analysis + Strategic Pivot
- Jay fed PRD to Claude for blind spot analysis
- Key feedback: Fiverr should be sandbox (stress-test agents), NOT the business model
- Real money: Productize the content machine as monthly subscription ($500-1500/mo per client)
- Orgo.ai (orgo.ai) = delivery mechanism — spin up isolated cloud computers per client
- Three-phase plan: Sandbox (wk 1-3) → Harden (wk 3-6) → Productize (wk 6+) → Platform (scale)
- Revenue model shift: Setup fee ($500-1500) + managed service ($300-800/mo) + self-managed ($150-300/mo)
- Missing from PRD: email sequence gig, priority queue for concurrency, PROSPECTOR platform ban risk
- Jay's insight: Fiverr gigs = QA process for the real product, not the product itself
- Claude analysis saved to: content-machine/Claude-jAY-prd DISCUSS2-22-26.txt
