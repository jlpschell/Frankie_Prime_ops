# Daily Log — 2026-02-21

## 12:00 PM — Security Incident: Public GitHub Repos with Exposed API Keys
- Discovered: ALL 8+ GitHub repos were PUBLIC
- Exposed keys: GHL PIT, Gemini (x3), OpenAI, Supabase service role, GitHub PAT, bridge tokens
- Actions: Scrubbed all keys from all .md files, purged git history (git-filter-repo), force-pushed, added .gitignore to all repos, removed PAT from remote URLs
- Jay made all repos private manually — confirmed zero visitors
- Pending: Key rotation checklist given to Jay (Gemini, OpenAI, GHL, Supabase service role, GitHub PAT)

## 12:15 PM — Obsidian Integration
- Installed obsidian-cli via npm (needed symlink: binary registers as 'obsidian' not 'obsidian-cli')
- Skill now shows ✓ ready in OpenClaw
- Jay created vault "Future_US" on Windows desktop
- Vault moved to OneDrive: C:\Users\Jay\OneDrive\Desktop\Future_US
- Seeded vault with starter notes: Home, Human Led AI, Jay Schell, Frankie System, Revenue Streams, GHL Integration, Daily template
- Created Remotely Save setup guide for iPhone sync (in Guides folder)
- REST API plugin installed (key in .env) but not needed — WSL can write directly to vault via /mnt/c/

## 12:08 PM — Heartbeat (skipped — active security incident)

## 12:45 PM — Transcription Capability Added
- Installed ffmpeg for audio extraction
- Successfully transcribed Jay's video message using OpenAI Whisper API

## 1:00 PM — Content Machine Architecture Designed
- Jay requested full content pipeline with sub-agents for humanledai.net
- Focus: AI news that affects businesses and individuals
- Designed 5-agent system: SCOUT (scrape), MINER (aggregate), FORGE (write), BLAST (distribute), GUARD (QA)
- All agent task files written with detailed instructions
- Config files: sources.json, brand-voice.md
- Estimated cost: ~$0.53/day ($16/month)
- Phase 1: Content staged for Jay's approval (no auto-posting)
- Pending: Wire up agents in openclaw.json, test first pipeline run
