# Daily Log — 2026-02-17

## [Prime] 5:20 AM — Morning Brief
- Delivered morning brief to Jay
- ACTIVE-TASKS.md was stale — still showed GHL as "NEEDS ATTENTION" despite last night's successful upload

## [Prime] 6:00-6:30 AM — Memory Failure Confrontation
- Jay called out that I had no memory of last night's 11:14 PM session
- Root cause: No daily log for Feb 16 existed. No Supabase conversation logs ever written.
- Pulled Discord chat history to reconstruct the full Feb 16 late-night session
- Created memory/2026-02-16.md with full session details
- Updated ACTIVE-TASKS.md to reflect actual current state:
  - P1: 738 contacts in GHL, 519 mobile-verified, tagged and campaign-ready
  - P2: 27 VM scripts written, awaiting Jay's review + ElevenLabs rendering
- Jay was rightfully pissed — I had the ElevenLabs task and didn't execute overnight

## [Prime] 6:30 AM — Supabase Audit
- Confirmed Supabase connection is live (URL + keys working)
- memories table: 37 entries, last write Feb 15
- conversations table: completely empty (never used)
- Jay took over to fix the memory system himself
- Told me to wait until he's done before customizing

## [Prime] ~6:45 AM — Supabase Tagging Discussion
- Jay cleared logs and made them generic
- New rule: ALL Supabase memory writes must be tagged as coming from Prime instance
- Local workspace memory/ files can stay generic (shared state)
- Awaiting Jay's confirmation on exact tagging convention

## Pending
- Jay's confirmation on Supabase tagging approach (asked, no response yet — likely at work all day)
- 27 VM scripts need ElevenLabs rendering (blocked until Jay says go)
- Massage spa Outscraper export still incoming
