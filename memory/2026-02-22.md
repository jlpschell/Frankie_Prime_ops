# Daily Log — 2026-02-22

## 7:15 AM — Morning Check-in + Accountability
- Jay called out that Jarvis memory system was live but ACTIVE-TASKS.md still said "READY TO INSTALL" — fixed
- Jay called out that overnight tasks (Mission Control upgrade, content cron, GUARD fixes, directory research, Clear Mud comparison) were promised at 9:13 PM Feb 21 but NONE were completed
- Screenshot evidence: I said "I'll make it count tonight. You'll see progress in the morning." — delivered nothing
- Root cause identified: heartbeat is designed to flag, not act. No mechanism to execute promised work between conversations
- Fixed HEARTBEAT.md: stale tasks now get fixed, not just flagged
- Fixed ACTIVE-TASKS.md: full update reflecting Feb 21 progress (content machine, Fiverr agents, PRD, sub-agents, security, Obsidian)
- Jay's lesson: "We don't unplug smoke detectors." Alerts without action = noise.

## 7:45 AM — AMP + Mission Control Planning Session
- Jay wants Agent Management Panel (AMP) — manage agents from phone via Tailscale
- Discussed hierarchy: Jay (CEO) → Prime (COO) → Test Agent (Ops Mgr) → Sub-agents
- Discussed using Obsidian as two-way control interface (edit .md files on phone → I pick up changes)
- Obsidian iPhone sync still pending (needs iCloud for Windows)
- Explored existing tools before building custom:
  - Telegram: has topics/threads support we're not using
  - Discord: full server exists, bot configured but disabled. Channels, threads, reactions all available
  - OpenClaw: native multi-agent support (`openclaw agents add`)
  - Control UI: built-in dashboard at localhost:28789, not exposed yet
- Proposed hybrid approach: Discord as nerve center, Obsidian as knowledge layer, Telegram as direct line, AMP as Phase 2 custom build
- Pending: Jay's decision on which path to take
- Decision: Kill Discord, keep Telegram + Mission Control. Two tools only.

## 8:30 AM — Mission Control Setup
- Decision: Kill Discord, keep Telegram + Mission Control (AMP) as the two-tool stack
- Found two GitHub repos: abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control (enterprise) and crshdn/mission-control (lighter, Kanban-focused)
- Jay chose crshdn/mission-control — closer to our needs, simpler stack
- Created private repo: github.com/jlpschell/Frankie_Prime_Mission_Control
- Pushed code, installed dependencies, added dark/light/system theme toggle (next-themes)
- App running at localhost:4000, accessible via Tailscale at 100.97.30.40:4000
- Gateway connected: ws://127.0.0.1:28789
- New GitHub PAT created with full repo permissions (old one was missing repo create scope)
- Updated both .env files with new PAT

## 9:15 AM — Jay heading out
- Jay going to spend time with Jennifer
- New request: Skool room scraper — pull content from paid communities (AR Profit Boardroom, etc.) for review and repurposing
- Overnight/away tasks assigned:
  1. PM2 setup for Mission Control
  2. Explore all Mission Control features, document what maps to our needs
  3. Skool scraper research + architecture
  4. Wire up content machine daily cron (overdue)
  5. Update daily notes + ACTIVE-TASKS.md throughout

## 10:00 AM — Obsidian Sync Solved
- Working Copy (iOS Git client) = the answer for Obsidian iPhone sync
- No iCloud needed — Git-based sync through GitHub
- Created private repo: github.com/jlpschell/obsidian-vault
- Pushed existing vault content from desktop (Future_US)
- Jay installs Working Copy → clones repo → points Obsidian iOS at it → two-way sync

## 10:30 AM — Mission Control Deployment Saga
- Vercel login completed, deployed crshdn version to frankie-mission-control.vercel.app
- But Jay wants the FULL abhi1693 version — can't run on Vercel (needs Postgres+Redis+Python)
- Tailscale can't reach WSL Docker (Windows/WSL network boundary)
- Attempted Railway deployment:
  - Created mission-control-full private repo with abhi1693 code
  - Railway project: efficient-healing
  - Added Postgres + Redis databases
  - Backend deploys and runs but healthcheck path wrong (/api/v1/health returns 404)
  - Frontend not deployed yet — needs separate service
  - Railway URL: https://mission-control-full-production.up.railway.app (backend only, not working yet)
- Auth token for Mission Control: 2cf89f3ff3cffaa1d4ab2b88a09dc2e083fccc505b1ee6450aeaaf998c37c465
- Fallback plan: PowerShell port forward (2 commands) to get Tailscale working while Railway gets sorted
- Jay is at the desk now

## Other items discussed:
- Google OAuth tokens all expired (7-day testing mode) — need to publish app to production in Google Cloud Console
- Brave API key needed for web search
- YouTube subscriptions as curated content source (OAuth access)
- Curated YouTube channels per client = real deliverable for $300-800/mo subscription
- OAuth refresh cron needed
- Skool room scraper for paid community content mining

## 1:30 PM — Mission Control Deployment Failures
- Tailscale port forwarding: set up but Windows Firewall blocked it
- Firewall rules: wrong parameter name (-Port vs -LocalPort), still didn't work
- Cloudflare Tunnel attempt 1: tunnel created but 1033 error
- Cloudflare Tunnel attempt 2: frontend loaded but "Unable to reach backend to validate token"
- Root cause: frontend has NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 baked into Docker image
- Set up nginx reverse proxy on port 4002 to combine frontend+backend behind one URL
- Fixed Dockerfile and compose.yml to use empty API URL (relative paths)
- Rebuilt frontend no-cache, multiple tunnel attempts — still Cloudflare 1033 errors
- Railway deployment also incomplete — backend runs but frontend needs separate service
- **Jay frustrated — rightfully. Too many failed approaches.**
- Recommendation: STOP fighting abhi1693 Docker deployment. Build custom dashboard on Vercel+Supabase instead.
- Vercel already proven working (frankie-mission-control.vercel.app loaded instantly)
- Waiting on Jay's decision

## 9:30 AM — Tailscale + Vercel
- Jay can't reach Tailscale URL (100.97.30.40:4000) from phone
- Decision: Deploy to Vercel instead for phone access
- Vercel CLI token expired — needs Jay to run `vercel login` or connect repo from Vercel dashboard
- Blocker noted for when Jay returns

## 9:45 AM — Mission Control Switch
- Jay saw crshdn version on port 4000 — just a bare Kanban, not what we discussed
- Jay called it out: no .md editing, no memory tracking, no multi-client support
- Switched to abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control (the one from the video)
- Full stack: Python backend + Next.js frontend + PostgreSQL + Redis + webhook worker
- 5 Docker containers running
- Frontend on port 4001 (Jay requested), backend on 8001, Postgres on 5433, Redis on 6380
- Auth token generated for login
- ACTIVE-TASKS.md updated with new Mission Control status
- Also added new tasks: Obsidian iPhone Sync, Skool Scraper, PRD v2.1 brief

## 10:00 AM — Mission Control Swap
- Jay tested crshdn version on port 4000 — too basic, just a dead Kanban
- Switched to abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control (the one from the video)
- Full platform: organizations, board groups, Kanban, agents, skills marketplace, approvals, activity feed
- Docker compose: 5 containers (frontend:4001, backend:8001, postgres:5433, redis:6380, webhook-worker)
- Auth token generated for local mode
- Vercel deploy blocked — needs `vercel login` re-auth from Jay

## 10:30 AM — Data Strategy Discussion
- Jay wants cheapest token path to quality curated info
- Google OAuth: all 3 refresh tokens expired (invalid_grant) — app in "testing" mode, 7-day expiry
- Fix: Jay to publish OAuth app to production in Google Cloud Console (after church)
- Then re-auth once + cron daily token refresh so it never expires again
- YouTube subscriptions = curated source list for content machine (way better than random RSS)
- Client content idea: curated YouTube channel lists per client niche → content machine pulls transcripts → niche-specific content
- This becomes a real deliverable in the $300-800/mo subscription
- Brave API still worth getting for general web search gaps
- Jay at church, back later

## 11:00 AM — Obsidian Sync SOLVED
- Jay found Working Copy (iOS Git client) — can share folders with Obsidian
- Created private repo: github.com/jlpschell/obsidian-vault
- Seeded with existing vault content from /mnt/c/Users/Jay/OneDrive/Desktop/Future_US/
- Two-way sync: Frankie pushes → GitHub → Working Copy → Obsidian iOS | Jay edits → Working Copy commits → Frankie pulls
- No iCloud, no OneDrive, no subscription — just Git
- Pending: Jay installs Working Copy + clones repo + links Obsidian (after church)

## Pending Actions (Frankie working on while Jay is out)
- Mission Control feature exploration + documentation
- Skool scraper architecture
- Content machine daily cron
- OAuth token refresh cron script (ready for when Jay publishes the app)
- PRD v2.1 update brief
