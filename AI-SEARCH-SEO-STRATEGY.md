# AI Search & SEO Strategy for Human Led AI
## The Landscape Shift: From Google Rankings to AI Agent Citations

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**For:** Human Led AI (Contractor AI Services - DFW Market)  
**Challenge:** Your niche (local contractors) is HIGHLY exposed to AI search — people ask ChatGPT/Perplexity "find me a roofer in Dallas" instead of Googling

---

## The New Reality: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

### What Changed
- **Old SEO:** Rank #1 for "Dallas roofing contractor" → get clicks
- **New AI Search:** ChatGPT/Perplexity/Google SGE **cite** trusted sources → become THE answer
- **Zero-click searches:** User gets answer in AI chat, never visits your site unless YOU'RE cited as the trusted source

### Why Contractors Are Exposed
1. **High local intent** — "I need a plumber NOW" → ChatGPT gives direct recommendations
2. **Trust-based decisions** — People ask AI "who's reliable?" not "show me 10 options"
3. **Voice search explosion** — "Hey Siri, find a roofer near me" → AI picks ONE based on trust signals
4. **Review aggregation** — AI scrapes Google/Yelp/BBB reviews and synthesizes a recommendation

**If you're not the source AI cites, you're invisible.**

## What AI Agents Actually Look For (Not Keywords)

### 1. **E-E-A-T on Steroids**
Traditional E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust) now matters 10x more:

| Signal | What AI Checks | How to Win |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Experience** | First-hand project examples, case studies, before/after photos | Document EVERY project with photos, costs, timelines. Build a portfolio library. |
| **Expertise** | Certifications, licenses, years in business, specialized knowledge | Display licenses prominently. Write educational content (not sales fluff). |
| **Authority** | Citations on other trusted sites, industry mentions, partnerships | Get listed on HomeAdvisor, Angi, BBB. Partner with suppliers (GAF, Owens Corning). |
| **Trust** | Reviews, Better Business Bureau rating, transparent pricing, guarantees | Collect reviews systematically. Display BBB A+ rating. Publish pricing guides. |

### 2. **Structured Data (Schema Markup)**
AI can't "see" your website like humans do — it reads structured data:

**Required schemas for contractors:**
```json
{
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "@type": "HomeAndConstructionBusiness",
  "name": "[Business Name]",
  "priceRange": "$$-$$$",
  "telephone": "(XXX) XXX-XXXX",
  "address": { "addressLocality": "Dallas", "addressRegion": "TX" },
  "aggregateRating": { "ratingValue": "4.9", "reviewCount": "127" },
  "areaServed": ["Dallas", "Plano", "Frisco", "McKinney"],
  "hasOfferCatalog": {
    "itemListElement": [
      { "name": "Roof Replacement", "price": "$8000-$15000" },
      { "name": "Roof Repair", "price": "$300-$1500" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why it matters:** When ChatGPT searches for "roofers in Plano," it reads this structured data first. If yours is complete and competitors' isn't, YOU get cited.

### 3. **Review Density & Recency**
AI heavily weights:
- **Volume:** 100+ reviews > 20 reviews
- **Recency:** Reviews in last 90 days > old reviews
- **Detail:** "They replaced my roof in 3 days, $12K, GAF shingles, very professional" > "Great service!"
- **Response rate:** You respond to ALL reviews (good + bad) signals trust

### 4. **Content Depth & Originality**
AI detects:
- **Thin content:** "We do roofing in Dallas. Call us!" = ignored
- **AI-generated fluff:** ChatGPT wrote it → ChatGPT ignores it
- **Deep, original content:** "Here's how we handle ice dam prevention in North Texas winters (rare but happens). We use heat cables + proper attic ventilation..." = cited

**What to write:**
- Local problem-solving guides ("How to handle hail damage claims in DFW")
- Transparent pricing breakdowns ("Why a 2,000 sqft roof costs $10K-$15K")
- Project walkthroughs with real numbers and photos
- Common mistakes homeowners make (educational, not salesy)

### 5. **Citations & Backlinks from Trusted Sources**
AI trusts sources that OTHER trusted sites link to:

**High-value citations for contractors:**
- Better Business Bureau (BBB.org)
- HomeAdvisor / Angi
- Manufacturer partner pages (GAF Certified, Owens Corning Preferred)
- Local chamber of commerce
- City/county contractor registries
- Local news mentions (sponsor a little league team → local paper covers it)

**Low-value (ignored by AI):**
- Random directory spam sites
- Paid "top 10 contractors" listicles
- Your own blog posts with no external validation

## Human Led AI's Unique Advantage (& How to Leverage It)

### Your Positioning
You're NOT a roofing company. You're **the AI that makes roofing companies better**. This is META — you're using AI to help contractors rank in AI search.

### The Irony Play
**Positioning:** "We use AI to make YOUR business the one ChatGPT recommends."

**Content strategy:**
1. **Educate contractors on this exact problem** — "Your competitors are invisible to ChatGPT. Here's why."
2. **Case study format** — "How we made [Dallas Roofer] the #1 ChatGPT recommendation in 60 days"
3. **Transparent playbook** — Publish YOUR methodology (builds trust, positions you as the expert AI cites)

**Why this works:**
- You're teaching the SAME principles you use (E-E-A-T, schema, reviews, content depth)
- Contractors searching "how to get more leads" will find YOU
- AI will cite YOUR content when contractors ask "how do I market my roofing business?"

## Immediate Action Plan for Human Led AI

### Phase 1: Prove It Works (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** Build ONE case study you can show contractors

1. **Pick a test niche** — roofers in Plano, TX (specific city, easier to dominate)
2. **Build the perfect contractor profile:**
   - Full schema markup (LocalBusiness + reviews + pricing)
   - 10 deep-content pages (e.g., "Plano Roof Hail Damage Guide")
   - Collect 20+ detailed reviews (use your AI to help write them based on real feedback)
   - Get BBB A+ rating, manufacturer certifications
3. **Test AI citations:**
   - Ask ChatGPT/Perplexity/Google SGE: "Best roofer in Plano, TX"
   - Track if your test contractor gets cited
   - Document the before/after

### Phase 2: Productize It (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal:** Turn the playbook into a repeatable service

1. **Create the "AI Visibility Audit"** — run any contractor's site through your checklist:
   - Schema markup score (0-100)
   - Review density (how many, how recent, how detailed)
   - Content depth score
   - Citation count (BBB, HomeAdvisor, manufacturers)
   - AI citation test (do they appear when you ask ChatGPT?)

2. **Build the "AI-Ready Contractor Package":**
   - Schema implementation
   - 10 deep-content pages (templated but customized per niche)
   - Review collection automation (AI writes personalized review requests)
   - Citation building (BBB signup, manufacturer partnerships, local press outreach)
   - Monthly AI citation tracking ("Here's where ChatGPT mentioned you this month")

3. **Price it at $497/mo or $2,997 one-time setup + $297/mo maintenance**

### Phase 3: Prove Social Proof (Weeks 9-16)
**Goal:** Get 3-5 contractors using it, document wins

1. **Offer pilot pricing** — $997 one-time for first 5 contractors (normally $2,997)
2. **Track everything:**
   - AI citation count (before/after)
   - Lead volume (before/after)
   - Review count (before/after)
3. **Turn into case studies** — "How [Plano Roofing Co] became ChatGPT's #1 recommendation"

### Phase 4: Scale Marketing (Weeks 17+)
**Goal:** Get Human Led AI cited as THE expert on contractor AI visibility

1. **Content blitz:**
   - "The Death of Google SEO for Contractors (And What Replaces It)"
   - "Why ChatGPT Ignores Your Roofing Company (And How to Fix It)"
   - "The AI Citation Playbook for Local Contractors"

2. **Distribution:**
   - LinkedIn (contractors + marketing agencies follow you)
   - YouTube (video walkthroughs of AI search tests)
   - Podcast tour (appear on contractor marketing podcasts)
   - Reddit (r/Entrepreneur, r/Roofing, r/HVAC)

3. **Meta play:**
   - When contractors ask ChatGPT "how do I market my roofing business?" → YOUR content gets cited
   - When agencies ask "how do we help clients with AI search?" → YOUR methodology gets cited

## Measurement: What to Track

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **AI Citation Rate** | Ask ChatGPT/Perplexity "best [niche] in [city]" weekly, track if your client is mentioned | 80% citation rate within 90 days |
| **Review Velocity** | New reviews per month | 5-10/month for active clients |
| **Schema Completeness** | Google Rich Results Test | 100% valid, no errors |
| **Content Depth** | Avg words per page, readability score, originality check | 1,500+ words, 8th grade reading level, <10% AI-detected |
| **Citation Count** | Backlinks from BBB, HomeAdvisor, Angi, manufacturers | 10+ high-authority citations |
| **Lead Attribution** | Ask new leads "How'd you find us?" | Track "ChatGPT" as a source |

## The Competitive Moat

**Why contractors can't just copy this:**
1. **They don't know it exists** — most contractors still think "Google ranking" is the goal
2. **They can't execute** — schema markup, content depth, review automation require technical chops
3. **They won't maintain it** — AI search evolves monthly, they need someone monitoring it

**Why agencies can't easily compete:**
1. **You have domain expertise** — you're AI-native, they're retrofitting old SEO
2. **You can move faster** — they have legacy clients, bloated processes
3. **You have proof** — case studies showing AI citation wins

## Tools You Need

| Tool | Purpose | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| **Schema.org Generator** | Build structured data | Free |
| **Google Rich Results Test** | Validate schema | Free |
| **ChatGPT/Perplexity API** | Automated citation testing | $20-50/mo |
| **Review collection automation** | Your AI writes personalized requests | Build it (use ElevenLabs for voice) |
| **Content originality checker** | Ensure not flagged as AI-generated | Copyscape ($10/mo) or Originality.ai ($15/mo) |

## Next Steps

1. **This week:** Pick ONE test contractor (friend/family/beta client), implement the full stack
2. **Document everything:** Screenshots of before/after AI citations, review growth, lead increase
3. **Build the audit tool:** Automate the "AI Visibility Score" so you can run it on ANY contractor site in 5 minutes
4. **Write the first case study:** Even if it's just 30 days of data, publish it
5. **Start the content engine:** One deep post per week on LinkedIn about AI search for contractors

---

## Why This Wins

**Traditional SEO is dying for local contractors.** AI search is eating their lunch. The contractors who adapt will dominate. The ones who don't will starve.

You're not selling "SEO." You're selling **survival in the AI search era**. That's a much bigger, scarier, more urgent problem.

And you're the only one in DFW (maybe Texas, maybe the whole damn country) who's positioning it this way for contractors specifically.

**First-mover advantage is MASSIVE here.** Move fast.
