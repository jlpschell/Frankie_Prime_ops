## ABOUT SECTION (Company Overview)

**Character count target: 2,000 max — aim for 1,200-1,500**

Contractors in DFW miss 40 to 60 percent of their incoming calls.

Not because they're lazy. Because they're working.

They're on a roof. Under a sink. In an attic. The phone rings and there's nobody to pick it up. The lead calls the next contractor on the list. The job is gone.

Human Led AI was built to fix exactly that.

We give contractors an AI-powered voice assistant that answers every call — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week — in your business name, with a professional voice, asking the right questions. It qualifies the lead. It books the appointment. It follows up automatically on leads that didn't book. And it sends you an instant notification when something hot comes in.

No call center. No virtual assistant to manage. No expensive full-time receptionist. Just a system that works while you work.

**Who we serve:**
Roofing, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, landscaping, concrete, fence, garage door, and painting contractors — primarily in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and across Texas.

**Why contractors choose us:**
Speed. The average contractor calls a lead back in 47 hours. Our system responds in under 2 minutes. Studies show leads contacted in 5 minutes convert 21x more than leads contacted after 30 minutes. That gap is where you win or lose.

Cost. A full-time receptionist runs $35,000-$45,000 a year. Our system costs a fraction of that and works nights, weekends, and holidays without overtime.

Simplicity. We handle the full setup. You don't need to be technical. You just need to want more booked jobs.

**We're not a tech company selling to contractors. We're operators who understand how the trades work — and built a system around how contractors actually run their businesses.**

If you're losing jobs because of unanswered calls, we should talk.

## 3 SHOWCASE POSTS — Launch Week

---

### LAUNCH POST 1 — Day 1 (Company Intro)

**Subject:** We launched. Here's why.

---

I've watched contractors lose jobs for the same reason for years.

Not bad work. Not bad pricing. Not bad reviews.

They just didn't answer the phone.

A roofer misses a storm call at 7am. An HVAC tech can't pick up at 2pm because he's on a job. A plumber gets a voicemail at 9pm from someone with a burst pipe — and by the time he calls back at 8am, they've already got someone else in their house.

The trades are full of people who are incredibly good at what they do. Most of them are terrible at the front end of their business — not because they don't care, but because they never had a system.

That's what Human Led AI is.

An AI that answers every call. Qualifies the lead. Books the appointment. Follows up automatically. Works 24/7 without overtime.

We built it for DFW contractors first — roofers, HVAC, plumbers, electricians, landscapers, concrete, fence, garage door, painters. But it works anywhere in Texas.

If you know a contractor who's tired of losing jobs to missed calls — send them to humanledai.net.

Demo takes 5 minutes. Results start in week one.

### LAUNCH POST 2 — Day 3 (Problem/Solution)

**Subject:** The number that should bother every contractor

---

47 hours.

That's the average time it takes a contractor to call back a new lead.

47 hours.

In roofing. In HVAC. In plumbing. In any trade where the homeowner is making a decision in real time.

Here's the other number: leads contacted within 5 minutes of inquiry are 21 times more likely to convert than leads contacted after 30 minutes.

21 times.

If you're calling back leads the next day — or the day after — you're not in the running. The job was decided hours ago.

This isn't a criticism of contractors. It's a systems problem. When you're on the job, you can't also be on the phone. When the crew needs you, you can't also be booking appointments.

The solution isn't working more hours. It's having a system that handles the front end while you handle the work.

Human Led AI answers the call in under 10 seconds. Responds to forms and after-hours inquiries in under 2 minutes. Books the appointment or starts the follow-up sequence automatically.

The 47 hours becomes 2 minutes.

That's the gap. That's where you win.

### LAUNCH POST 3 — Day 5 (Social Proof + CTA)

**Subject:** What "100% answer rate" actually looks like

---

Most contractors track a lot of things.

Revenue. Jobs completed. Materials cost. Crew hours.

Almost none of them track their call answer rate.

Because if they did, the number would be uncomfortable.

We work with contractors who — before they set up Human Led AI — were catching maybe 50-60% of their incoming calls. The rest went to voicemail. Half those voicemails never got a callback. The leads who did get a callback waited an average of 4-6 hours.

After setup:

✅ 100% of calls answered
✅ Leads responded to in under 2 minutes
✅ Appointments booked automatically
✅ Follow-up sequences running on every unbooked lead

The business didn't change. The work didn't change. The crew didn't change.

Just the front end. The phone system. The first impression.

That's enough to meaningfully change the number of jobs booked every single month.

If you run a contracting business in DFW — or anywhere in Texas — and you want to see what this looks like for YOUR company:

Book a 5-minute demo at humanledai.net

I'll call your number. You'll hear it. You'll decide.
