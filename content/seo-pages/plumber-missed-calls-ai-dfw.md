## A Burst Pipe at Midnight. A Homeowner Panicking. Your Phone Goes to Voicemail.

Guess what they do next. They call the next plumber on the list.

Plumbing is emergency-driven. The homeowner with water shooting out from under their sink doesn't have the patience to leave a voicemail and wait. They need someone now. And "now" means whoever picks up the phone in the next 60 seconds.

If that's not you, it's your competitor.

Human Led AI makes sure it's always you.

## You Can't Answer the Phone When You're Under a Sink

And you shouldn't have to. That's the whole point.

You became a plumber to fix pipes, not sit by the phone. But the business doesn't care about that — if a lead calls and nobody answers, the lead is gone. Simple as that.

The solution isn't "hire a receptionist" (they go home at 5pm). The solution isn't "check voicemail more often" (too slow). The solution is a system that never sleeps, never misses a call, and turns every ring into a booked appointment.

That's Human Led AI.

## What Our System Does for DFW Plumbers

**Answers every call instantly — including nights and weekends**
Most plumbing emergencies happen after hours. Burst pipes. Backed-up sewers. Broken water heaters at 11pm. Our AI picks up on the first ring, every time, in your company name.

**Handles emergency vs. non-emergency triage**
The system is trained to identify urgent calls and flag them immediately so you can decide whether to dispatch or schedule next-day. You're not dealing with paperwork at 2am — just a text telling you exactly what the situation is.

**Books service calls on the spot**
For non-emergency jobs — drain cleaning, fixture installs, inspections — the AI books the appointment directly into your calendar. No callbacks. No double-booking. No back-and-forth.

**Follows up on every lead that didn't book**
Most homeowners don't book on the first call. They hang up and think about it. Our system sends a follow-up text and email automatically — and keeps following up until they either book or ask to stop.

**Speed-to-lead: under 2 minutes**
When someone submits a form or calls after hours, they get a text response in under 2 minutes. In plumbing, that kind of speed wins jobs.

## The Numbers You Need to See

- Average plumbing service call: $300–$800
- Average full repipe or major repair: $2,000–$8,000
- Calls missed per week by the average 1-5 person plumbing company: 8-15
- Revenue lost per missed call (conservative): $500

If you're missing 10 calls a week and only 30% were real leads — that's $1,500 a week, $6,000 a month, $72,000 a year in lost revenue.

You're already paying for Google Ads, HomeAdvisor, Angi, or word-of-mouth marketing. Let's make sure the leads actually get answered.
