## You're Losing Jobs Every Single Day — And You Probably Don't Know It

Let's be straight with you. If you're a contractor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area running a busy crew, you're missing calls. Not because you're bad at your job — because you're *doing* your job. You're on a roof. Under a sink. In a crawlspace. Your phone's ringing and nobody's picking up.

Industry data says contractors miss 40 to 60 percent of their incoming calls. Do the math on your own business. If a roofing job is worth $8,000 and you miss three calls a week, that's over a million dollars a year walking out the door. Gone to the competitor who answered.

That's the problem Human Led AI was built to fix.

## What We Do (In Plain English)

We give your contracting business an AI-powered voice assistant that answers every call, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week — including nights, weekends, and holidays when homeowners are most likely to call.

Here's what it actually does:

- **Answers every call** in your business name, in a professional voice, on the first ring
- **Qualifies the lead** — asks the right questions so you know what you're walking into
- **Books the appointment** directly into your calendar
- **Sends follow-up texts and emails** automatically to leads that didn't book
- **Notifies you instantly** when a hot lead comes in so you can jump on it fast

No call center. No virtual assistant you have to train. No monthly headcount. Just a system that works while you work.

## Built for DFW Contractors

We're not selling a generic tech product to Fortune 500 companies. Human Led AI was built specifically for the trades — roofers, HVAC techs, plumbers, electricians, landscapers, painters, concrete crews, fence companies, garage door operators. All of them. All across Dallas, Fort Worth, Plano, Frisco, McKinney, Arlington, Irving, Garland, Mesquite, and the surrounding communities.

If your business runs on inbound calls and referrals — and most contractor businesses do — then every unanswered call is a direct hit to your revenue.

We fix that.

## Why Contractors in DFW Choose Human Led AI

**Speed:** The average contractor calls a lead back in 47 hours. Our system responds in under 2 minutes — automatically. Studies show that leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert than those contacted after 30 minutes.

**Cost:** A full-time receptionist in DFW runs $35,000-$45,000 a year. Our system costs a fraction of that — and works nights and weekends without overtime.

**Simplicity:** We set it up for you. You don't need to be tech-savvy. You just need to want more booked jobs.

**Local:** We know DFW. We know the market. We know what homeowners in Southlake and Garland are looking for when they search for a contractor at 9pm on a Sunday.
