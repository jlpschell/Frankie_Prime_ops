## Roofing Season Is 24/7. Is Your Phone?

You've got a crew in the field. A storm rolled through last night. Your phone is blowing up with inspection requests — and you're on a roof in Plano with your hands full.

Meanwhile, the homeowner who called you at 7:30am is now calling your competitor. Then another one. Then another.

This is the roofing business. You know this. The difference between a $50,000 storm season and a $200,000 storm season often comes down to who picks up the phone first.

Human Led AI picks up the phone. Every time. For every call.

## What Dallas Roofers Actually Need

You don't need more software to learn. You need someone — or something — that handles the front end so you can stay focused on the job.

Here's what our AI receptionist does for Dallas roofing companies:

**Answers every call 24/7**
Storm calls come in at night. Weekend. During your lunch break. During your inspection. Our system picks up every single one on the first ring, in your company name, sounding professional.

**Qualifies the lead immediately**
It asks the right questions — location, type of damage, homeowner or rental, insurance or out-of-pocket. You know what you're walking into before you call back.

**Books the inspection**
Syncs with your calendar and schedules the appointment on the spot — no back-and-forth, no phone tag.

**Follows up on leads that didn't book**
Most homeowners shop around. If they didn't book right away, our system sends a text and email follow-up sequence automatically to bring them back.

**Notifies you instantly**
Hot lead comes in? You get a text with all the details within 60 seconds.

## The Math Is Simple

A roofing job in the DFW market averages $8,000-$15,000 for a full replacement. If you miss 5 calls during a hail event and only 2 of those were real leads — that's $16,000 to $30,000 you didn't get.

You probably spend $2,000-$5,000 a month on ads and marketing. What's the point if nobody answers the phone?

Fix the leak. Answer the call.

When the next hail storm hits North Texas, your phone will be covered.

## What This Is Not

This is not a call center in the Philippines reading from a script. This is not a voicemail box with a fancy interface. This is not something your office manager has to manage.

It's a fully automated AI system that learns your business, speaks in your brand, and works while you sleep.
