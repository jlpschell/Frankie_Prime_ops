## Texas Contractors Are Leaving Money on the Table Every Single Day

You built your business the hard way. Showing up early, doing good work, earning referrals. But somewhere between the job site and the phone — leads are slipping through the cracks.

You're not losing jobs because your work is bad. You're losing them because nobody picked up the phone.

That's an operations problem. And it has a straightforward fix.

## Human Led AI: Built for the Trades in Texas

We're not a software company selling to hospitals and law firms. We built this specifically for contractors — roofers, HVAC techs, plumbers, electricians, landscapers, concrete crews, fence companies, garage door operators, and painters.

If your business runs on inbound calls and you're based anywhere in Texas — DFW, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, or anywhere in between — this was built for you.

## The Three Things Killing Your Lead Pipeline

**1. Unanswered calls**
You're on a job. The phone rings. Nobody answers. The homeowner calls your competitor. You never even knew the lead existed.

**2. Slow follow-up**
A lead calls, leaves a voicemail, and waits. You get back to them 4 hours later. They've already hired someone else. Studies show the conversion rate on leads drops 80% after 5 minutes.

**3. No system for leads that didn't book**
Most people don't book on the first contact. Without an automated follow-up sequence, those "warm" leads go cold and disappear. You need to stay in front of them — automatically — until they either book or opt out.

Human Led AI fixes all three. Simultaneously.

## What the System Does

### AI Voice Answering — 24/7
Every call answered on the first ring. Your business name. A professional voice. The right questions asked. The lead captured.

### Automated Lead Follow-Up
Leads who don't book get a text and email sequence that follows up automatically — at the right intervals — until they respond. Your competitors aren't doing this. Most of them don't even know they should be.

### Appointment Booking
The AI books jobs directly into your calendar. No back-and-forth. No scheduling calls. The homeowner picks a time and it's done.

### Instant Lead Notifications
When a hot lead comes in — new job, urgent request, big project — you get a text notification with the full details within 60 seconds.

### Lead Qualification
Not every call is a good job. Our system asks the questions that matter — scope, budget, timeline, location — so you know what you're dealing with before you pick up the phone.

## What This Costs vs. What It Makes You

Let's be direct about money.

A full-time receptionist in Texas runs $30,000–$42,000 per year. Plus benefits. Plus training. Plus they go home at 5pm and take weekends off.

Human Led AI costs a fraction of that and works around the clock.

More importantly: if you're missing 10 calls a week and even 20% of those are real leads — at an average job value of $1,000 — that's $2,000 a week in missed revenue. $104,000 a year. Going to whoever answered their phone.

This isn't an expense. It's a revenue recovery investment.
