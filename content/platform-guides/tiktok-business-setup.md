## WHAT YOU'LL NEED BEFORE STARTING

- [ ] Phone (TikTok is built for mobile — do this on your phone)
- [ ] TikTok app downloaded (free in App Store or Google Play)
- [ ] Your logo saved to your phone (400x400px)

## THE TIKTOK OPPORTUNITY (READ THIS FIRST)

TikTok is the only platform where a brand-new account with zero followers can get 10,000-100,000 views on a first video. That doesn't happen on Facebook or LinkedIn.

For Human Led AI, TikTok is primarily a **contractor education channel** — short, punchy videos that teach contractors something useful, with Human Led AI positioned as the solution.

Target audience on TikTok: Contractors 25-45 who use their phone constantly and watch quick how-to and business content.

## STEP 5 — YOUR FIRST VIDEO

**The fastest way to make your first video:**

Go somewhere with decent lighting (outside during the day, or near a bright window). Use your phone in vertical position (portrait mode).

**Option A — Face-to-camera (most effective):**
Talk for 45-60 seconds. Script below.

**Option B — Screen recording + voiceover:**
Record your phone screen showing a call coming in and the AI answering. Talk over it.

**Option C — Text overlay only:**
Record anything (your truck, your desk, job site B-roll) and add text overlays with music.

---

### FIRST VIDEO SCRIPT — "The Problem" (45 seconds)

**Hook (first 3 seconds — this is everything):**
> "Contractors are losing $5,000-$10,000 a month and most don't even know it."

**Body (next 35 seconds):**
> "Here's how. You're on a job. Your phone rings. You can't pick up. Voicemail. 
> That was a $2,000 job. 
> 
> The average contractor misses 40-60% of incoming calls. And the average 
> callback time is 47 HOURS. By then? The homeowner called three other 
> contractors and already booked someone.
>
> We built an AI system that answers your phone 24/7, in your business name, 
> qualifies the lead, and books the appointment — while you're on the job.
>
> I'm going to show you exactly how it works this week."

**CTA (last 5 seconds):**
> "Follow for more. Link in bio for a free demo."

---

## STEP 6 — POST YOUR VIDEO

1. Tap the **"+"** button at the bottom of the screen
2. Either record new or upload from your camera roll
3. Add a **caption:**

```
Contractors are losing $5k-$10k/month and don't know it 😬

The average contractor misses 40-60% of incoming calls.
Average callback time: 47 HOURS.

We built an AI that fixes that.

6. Tap **Post**

## TIKTOK CONTENT STRATEGY

### Video Ideas — Post 2-3x per Week

**Series: "The Missed Call Chronicles"**
- Short clips exposing how much money contractors lose from missed calls
- Use actual math: "If you miss 10 calls a week and 3 are real leads at $1,500/job — that's $225,000/year walking out the door"

**Series: "AI Myth vs. Reality"**
- "Most contractors think AI sounds robotic. Here's what it actually sounds like."
- Record a demo call and play it

**Series: "Before/After Setup"**
- "This HVAC company was at 50% call answer rate. After 30 days: 100%."
- Tell the story (anonymized or with permission)

**Format that works well for this audience:**
- Problem → Agitate → Solve (30-60 seconds)
- "Did you know?" stats
- "Watch me call a contractor business [and AI answers]" — people love seeing it live
- Day-in-the-life content from a contractor's perspective (position yourself as contractor-friendly)

### Hashtag Strategy

**Always include:**
```
#Contractor #ContractorLife #DFW #HVAC #Roofing #Plumbing #Electrician #SmallBusiness #AI
```

**Rotate these in:**
```
#BusinessGrowth #MissedCalls #SpeedToLead #ContractorBusiness #AITechnology 
#NeverMissACall #DFWBusiness #TexasContractor #HumanLedAI
```

## TIKTOK REALITY CHECK

- **Don't obsess over your first video.** Post it. Learn. Post again. The algorithm rewards consistency more than perfection.
- **The first 10-20 videos are your training ground.** You're figuring out what resonates.
- **One viral video can generate 50+ inbound leads.** It happens. Keep posting.
- **Video views don't always equal leads.** Your bio link and CTA need to be clear.
- **Minimum viable commitment:** 2 videos per week. Miss weeks and the algorithm forgets you.
