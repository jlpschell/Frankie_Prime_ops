## Human Led AI

**Estimated time:** 30–45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy — most of this is done from your phone

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED BEFORE STARTING

- [ ] Your phone (Instagram is primarily a mobile app — do this setup on your phone)
- [ ] Instagram app downloaded (App Store or Google Play — it's free)
- [ ] Your Facebook Business Page already set up (you'll link them — see facebook-business-page-setup.md)
- [ ] Your logo (400x400px — saved to your phone's photo library)
- [ ] Your bio text (in this guide — copy it before you start)

---

## STEP 1 — CREATE AN INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT

1. Open the **Instagram app** on your phone
2. Tap **"Create new account"**
3. Enter your **email address:** `humanledai@gmail.com`
4. Create a **password** (save it somewhere — use a password manager or write it down)
5. Enter your **name:** `Human Led AI`
6. Choose a **username:**
   ```
   humanledai
   ```
   *(If taken, try: humanledai.ai or humanledai.dfw or humanledai_official)*
7. Tap **Next** through the rest of the setup prompts

---

## STEP 2 — SWITCH TO A BUSINESS ACCOUNT

By default Instagram creates a personal account. Switch it to Business.

1. Tap your **profile picture** in the bottom right
2. Tap the **three horizontal lines** (menu) in the top right
3. Tap **"Settings and privacy"**
4. Scroll down and tap **"Account type and tools"**
5. Tap **"Switch to Professional Account"**
6. Choose **"Business"** (not Creator)
7. Select your category: **Business & Utility Services** or **Product/Service**
8. Confirm your contact info and tap **Done**

---

## STEP 3 — CONNECT TO YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE

This is important — it links both platforms so you can post to both at once from Instagram.

1. Go to **Settings and privacy** → **Account** → **Linked accounts**
2. Tap **Facebook**
3. Log in to Facebook if prompted
4. Select your **Human Led AI** Facebook Business Page
5. Tap **Connect**

*(You'll know it worked when you see the Facebook Page name appear as "Connected.")*

---

## STEP 4 — UPLOAD YOUR PROFILE PICTURE

1. On your profile page, tap **"Edit profile"**
2. Tap the circle at the top (your profile photo area)
3. Choose **"Select from library"** and pick your logo
4. Your logo will be shown in a circle crop — make sure the icon is centered
5. Tap **Done**

---

## STEP 5 — WRITE YOUR BIO

In the "Edit profile" screen:

**Name field** (this is separate from username — it's what people see and what Instagram searches):
```
Human Led AI
```

**Bio field** (150 characters max):
```
AI that answers your calls 24/7 so you never lose another job.
Built for contractors 🔧 DFW + Texas
👇 Book a free demo
```

**Website field:**
```
humanledai.net
```

*(Instagram only allows ONE clickable link. That's your website.)*

Tap **Done** / **Submit**.

---

## STEP 6 — SET UP YOUR CONTACT BUTTON

Since you have a Business account, you get a Contact button on your profile.

1. Tap **"Edit profile"**
2. Tap **"Contact options"**
3. Add your phone number: `[PHONE]`
4. Add your email: `humanledai@gmail.com`
5. Under "Business address," you can skip this or add DFW if you want
6. Tap **Done**

Now people can tap "Contact" directly from your profile.

---

## STEP 7 — CREATE YOUR FIRST 3 POSTS

Post these in order. They set up your profile grid and tell your story.

---

### POST 1 — Who You Are

**Image:** Create a graphic in Canva (1080x1080px)
- Navy background (`#1A2E5A`)
- White text: **"Never Miss Another Call"**
- Subtext: **"AI answering for contractors. 24/7."**
- Your logo in the corner
- Website at the bottom: **humanledai.net**

**Caption:**
```
If you're a contractor in DFW, you're probably missing 40-60% of your incoming calls.

Not because you're not working hard — because you're ON the job.

Every missed call = a job that went to your competitor.

Human Led AI answers every call, 24/7, in your business name. It qualifies the lead, 
books the appointment, and follows up automatically.

No receptionist. No call center. Setup in under a week.

### POST 2 — The Problem

**Image:** Create in Canva (1080x1080px)
- White background
- Bold dark text: **"47 hours."**
- Subtext: **"That's how long the average contractor waits to call back a lead."**
- Bottom: **"We fix that. humanledai.net"**

**Caption:**
```
47 hours.

That's the average time it takes a contractor to call back a new lead.

Leads contacted within 5 minutes convert 21x more than leads contacted after 30 minutes.

If you're calling back leads the next day — the job is already gone.

Human Led AI responds in under 2 minutes. Automatically.

The math doesn't lie. The system works. 👇

## STEP 8 — SET UP STORY HIGHLIGHTS

Story Highlights are the circles that live permanently on your profile. Set up 3-4 to organize your content.

After posting your first few stories, save them as Highlights:

| Highlight Name | What Goes In It |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **How It Works** | Short clips/graphics showing the AI answering a call |
| **Demos** | Video of a live demo call |
| **FAQ** | Common questions with simple text answers |
| **Reviews** | Client testimonials once you have them |

To create a Highlight:
1. Tap the **"+"** circle on your profile (below your bio)
2. Select stories to include
3. Name it (use the names above)
4. Set a cover image

## INSTAGRAM CONTENT STRATEGY (QUICK NOTES)

- **Post frequency:** 3-4x per week minimum to grow
- **Best content types for this business:** Before/after stories ("contractor was missing calls, now books 8 more jobs/month"), short video clips of the AI in action, stat graphics ("47 hours → 2 minutes")
- **Reels > posts** for reach — short vertical videos get 3-5x more views than static images
- **Hashtags:** Use 5-10 relevant hashtags per post (not 30 — Instagram de-emphasizes that)
- **Core hashtags to always include:** #DFWContractors #HVAC #Roofing #Plumbing #Electrician #ContractorLife #AITechnology #NeverMissACall
