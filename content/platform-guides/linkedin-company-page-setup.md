**Estimated time:** 30–45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy — just follow the steps and paste the copy

---

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED BEFORE STARTING

- [ ] Personal LinkedIn account (required — same as Facebook, you need a personal account to own a Company Page)
- [ ] Your logo (300x300px minimum — square PNG with transparent or white background)
- [ ] Your banner image (1128x191px — wide and short)
- [ ] The copy from this guide (or reference `content/linkedin/company-page-copy.md`)

---

## STEP 1 — GO TO LINKEDIN AND CREATE A COMPANY PAGE

1. Log into your personal LinkedIn (linkedin.com)
2. In the top-right area of the screen, click the **grid icon** (looks like 9 dots) or find **"Work"** at the top right
3. Scroll to the bottom of the dropdown and click **"Create a Company Page"**
4. You'll be taken to a page with four options — choose **"Small business"**

---

## STEP 2 — FILL IN THE BASIC INFO

You'll see a form. Fill it out exactly like this:

**Company name:**
```
Human Led AI
```

**LinkedIn public URL** (this is your linkedin.com/company/_______ address):
```
humanledai
```
*(If taken, try: human-led-ai or humanledai-ai)*

**Website:**
```
https://humanledai.net
```

**Industry:** Click the dropdown and select:
`Technology, Information and Internet`
*(Type "technology" and it'll appear)*

**Company size:** Select: `2-10 employees`

**Company type:** Select: `Privately Held`

Then check the verification box: *"I verify that I am an authorized representative of this organization"*

Click **Create Page**.

---

## STEP 3 — UPLOAD YOUR LOGO

After the page is created, click **"Upload a logo"** in the prompt, or click the camera icon on the circular profile area.

- Upload your logo at 300x300px or larger (it'll be displayed as a square/circle)
- File should be PNG with clean background (white or transparent)
- Click Save

---

## STEP 4 — UPLOAD YOUR BANNER IMAGE

The banner is 1128x191px — very wide and very short.

1. Click the **pencil/edit icon** on the banner area
2. Upload your 1128x191px banner
3. LinkedIn lets you slide it up/down slightly — center it
4. Click Apply

**What should your banner say?**
Simple. Bold white text on Navy `#1A2E5A` background:
```

Design in Canva — search "LinkedIn Company Page Banner." Takes 15 minutes.

## STEP 5 — WRITE YOUR TAGLINE

There's a "Tagline" field shown under your company name.

**Paste this:**
```
We answer the calls your competition is missing.
```

*(This is the top recommendation from `content/linkedin/company-page-copy.md` — short, punchy, speaks to the pain.)*

---

## STEP 6 — WRITE YOUR ABOUT SECTION

1. Click the **pencil icon** on the Overview section of your page
2. You'll see an "About us" text field (2,000 character max)

**Paste this (full version from `content/linkedin/company-page-copy.md`):**
```
Contractors in DFW miss 40 to 60 percent of their incoming calls.

Not because they're lazy. Because they're working.

They're on a roof. Under a sink. In an attic. The phone rings and there's nobody 
to pick it up. The lead calls the next contractor on the list. The job is gone.

Human Led AI was built to fix exactly that.

We give contractors an AI-powered voice assistant that answers every call — 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week — in your business name, with a professional voice, asking the 
right questions. It qualifies the lead. It books the appointment. It follows up 
automatically on leads that didn't book. And it sends you an instant notification 
when something hot comes in.

No call center. No virtual assistant to manage. No expensive full-time receptionist. 
Just a system that works while you work.

Who we serve: Roofing, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, landscaping, concrete, fence, 
garage door, and painting contractors — primarily in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex 
and across Texas.

The average contractor calls a lead back in 47 hours. Our system responds in under 
2 minutes. Leads contacted in 5 minutes convert 21x more than leads contacted after 
30 minutes. That gap is where you win or lose.

Setup in under a week. We handle everything. You don't need to be technical.

## NEXT STEPS AFTER SETUP

1. **Invite your LinkedIn connections** to follow the page — there's an "Invite connections" button, use it
2. **Post from your PERSONAL profile** and tag @HumanLedAI — personal posts get more reach than company posts
3. **Connect with DFW contractors** on your personal LinkedIn — they become your audience
4. **Engage with contractor-related content** — comment helpfully before promoting
5. First 90 days: focus on content > follower count. One great post beats 1,000 followers who don't engage
