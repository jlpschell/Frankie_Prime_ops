## Human Led AI

**Estimated time:** 45–60 minutes setup + up to 5 business days for verification
**Difficulty:** Easy — but there's a verification step that requires a little patience

> **Important:** All the content for this guide (descriptions, services, Q&A, posts) is pre-written in `content/gbp/gbp-setup.md`. This guide gives you the step-by-step walkthrough. Use both together.

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED BEFORE STARTING

- [ ] Google account logged in: `humanledai@gmail.com`
- [ ] Your phone handy (verification may require a phone call or text)
- [ ] Your logo (250x250px minimum, higher is better)
- [ ] Cover photo (1080x608px recommended)
- [ ] The GBP content file open: `content/gbp/gbp-setup.md`
- [ ] Your business address OR ability to designate as "service area only" (no physical office required)

---

## STEP 1 — GO TO GOOGLE BUSINESS AND START

1. Open a browser and go to: **business.google.com**
2. Click **"Manage now"** or **"Add your business"**
3. You'll be asked to sign in — use `humanledai@gmail.com`

*(If you already have a GBP in progress or a listing shows up for your phone number, click "Claim this business" instead of creating a new one.)*

---

## STEP 2 — ENTER YOUR BUSINESS NAME

You'll see a screen that says "What's the name of your business?"

**Type exactly:**
```
Human Led AI
```

Press Enter / Continue.

*(If Google suggests existing businesses — ignore them and click "Create a business with this name.")*

---

## STEP 3 — CHOOSE YOUR BUSINESS CATEGORY

You'll be asked "What category best describes your business?"

**Type in the search box:**
```
Business Management Consultant
```

Select it when it appears.

*(You'll be able to add secondary categories later — see Step 8.)*

---

## STEP 4 — DO YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL LOCATION?

Google will ask: "Do you want to add a location customers can visit?"

**Select: "No"**

*(Human Led AI is a service-area business — you go to clients or work remotely. You don't need a storefront address. If you have a physical office you want listed, select "Yes" and enter the address.)*

---

## STEP 5 — SET YOUR SERVICE AREA

Google will ask: "Where do you serve customers?"

Add each of these:

```
Dallas, TX
Fort Worth, TX
Plano, TX
Frisco, TX
McKinney, TX
Arlington, TX
Irving, TX
Garland, TX
Denton, TX
Richardson, TX
Lewisville, TX
Carrollton, TX
Grand Prairie, TX
Mesquite, TX
Southlake, TX
```

*(You can also just type "Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex" and it may accept the whole area at once.)*

Click **Next**.

---

## STEP 6 — ADD YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION

**Phone:**
```
[PHONE]
```

**Website:**
```
https://humanledai.net
```

Click **Next**.

---

## STEP 7 — VERIFY YOUR BUSINESS

Google will ask how you want to verify your business. Options vary but typically include:

**Phone verification (fastest):**
- Google calls or texts your number
- You enter the 5-digit code
- Instant verification

**Email verification:**
- Google sends a code to humanledai@gmail.com
- Check your inbox, enter the code
- Usually same-day

**Postcard verification (slowest):**
- Google mails a postcard to your address with a code
- Takes 5-14 days
- Only needed if other methods aren't available for a service-area business

**If you see "Get verified later":**
- Don't skip — unverified profiles show up with a "Claimed, unverified" warning
- Verified profiles rank better in local search

Complete verification before moving on.

---

## STEP 8 — FILL IN YOUR FULL PROFILE

Once verified (or while waiting for verification), you can fill in the rest of your profile.

Go to your GBP dashboard at **business.google.com**

### 8a — Business Description

Click **"Edit profile"** → find "Description" field (750 character limit).

**Paste this from `content/gbp/gbp-setup.md`:**
```
Human Led AI gives DFW contractors a 24/7 AI answering system that captures every 
call, qualifies leads, books appointments, and follows up automatically. Built 
specifically for roofers, HVAC techs, plumbers, electricians, landscapers, painters, 
fence, concrete, and garage door contractors. Stop losing jobs because nobody picked 
up. Our AI answers in your business name, on the first ring, around the clock — at 
a fraction of the cost of a receptionist. Setup in under a week. No tech skills 
required. Book a free demo at humanledai.net.
```

### 8b — Business Hours

Click **"Edit hours"**:
- Monday–Friday: **9:00 AM – 6:00 PM**
- Saturday: **By appointment** (or Closed)
- Sunday: **Closed**

*(Tip: Add a note in your description mentioning 24/7 AI availability — that's a differentiator.)*

### 8c — Add Secondary Categories

Click **"Edit profile"** → find Categories section → click **"Add another category"**

Add these (if available in Google's list):
- Marketing Agency
- Technology Company
- Call Center

*(Not all categories exist in GBP — just add what Google offers that's closest.)*

---

## STEP 9 — ADD YOUR SERVICES

This is one of the most important steps for SEO. GBP surfaces your services in relevant searches.

1. In your GBP dashboard, click **"Services"**
2. Add each service from the list below (from `content/gbp/gbp-setup.md`):

| Service Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| AI Voice Answering for Contractors | 24/7 call answering in your business name. Never miss a lead again. |
| Lead Follow-Up Automation | Automated text and email sequences that chase leads until they book or opt out. |
| Appointment Booking Automation | AI books jobs directly into your calendar. No phone tag. |
| Missed Call Recovery | System identifies and re-engages missed calls automatically. |
| After-Hours Call Answering | Captures leads nights, weekends, and holidays when competitors go dark. |
| Lead Qualification System | AI asks the right questions so you know exactly what you're walking into before you call back. |
| Contractor AI Setup & Onboarding | Full-service setup customized to your trade, service area, and schedule. |
| AI Receptionist for Roofing Companies | Specialized answering and lead capture for storm and residential roofing. |
| HVAC Lead Automation | 2-minute lead response and scheduling for HVAC companies. |
| Plumbing Emergency Call Triage | 24/7 answering with emergency vs. non-emergency qualification. |

---

## STEP 10 — UPLOAD YOUR PHOTOS

Photos dramatically improve click-through rates and build trust.

1. In your GBP dashboard, click **"Photos"**
2. Click the **"+"** to upload

**Required uploads (do these first):**

| Photo Type | File | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Logo | 250x250px+ PNG | Shows next to your name in search + Maps |
| Cover Photo | 1080x608px | First visual when someone taps your listing |
| Business photo | Any relevant image | Shows your credibility |

**What to use if you don't have custom photos:**
- Your logo on a navy background
- A graphic showing "24/7 AI Answering" (make in Canva)
- Screenshot of a demo call (with client permission)

**Photo priority:** Logo first. Cover second. Everything else is bonus.

---

## STEP 11 — PRE-POPULATE YOUR Q&A

Google allows business owners to post their OWN questions and answers before customers do. Do this — don't wait for random people to ask.

1. Search for your business on Google Maps
2. Scroll down to find the **"Questions & Answers"** section
3. Tap **"Ask a question"** — then answer it yourself immediately

**Add all 7 Q&A pairs from `content/gbp/gbp-setup.md`:**

Quick summary of questions to add:
1. Does the AI actually sound like a real person?
2. How long does setup take?
3. What trades do you work with?
4. What does it cost?
5. Can it handle emergency calls?
6. Do you serve contractors outside of DFW?
7. What if I already have a receptionist or answering service?

*(Full answers are in `content/gbp/gbp-setup.md` — copy/paste each one.)*

---

## STEP 12 — PUBLISH YOUR FIRST GOOGLE POST

Google Posts appear directly in your business listing in search results. They're free and get shown.

1. In GBP dashboard, click **"Posts"** → **"Add update"**
2. Choose **"What's new"** or **"Offer"**

**Paste Post #1 from `content/gbp/gbp-setup.md`:**
*(It's the "DFW Contractors: Stop Losing Jobs to Missed Calls" post.)*

Add the CTA button: **"Book"** → URL: `https://humanledai.net`

Click **Post**.

---

## STEP 13 — ENABLE MESSAGING

GBP has a built-in messaging feature. Customers can text you directly from your listing.

1. In GBP dashboard → **"Messages"**
2. Turn it **On**
3. Set an auto-reply (shows instantly when someone messages you):

**Paste this as your auto-reply:**
```
Hey! Thanks for reaching out to Human Led AI. We'll get back to you within a couple 
hours during business hours. Want faster service? Call or text [PHONE] or book a 
demo at humanledai.net. We typically respond same day.
```
