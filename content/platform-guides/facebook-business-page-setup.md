## STEP 5 — SET YOUR HOURS

You'll see a "Hours" screen.

*(These are your business hours — the AI itself runs 24/7, which you'll explain in your description.)*

Click **Next**, then click **"Create Page"** when prompted.

After the page is created, Facebook will prompt you to upload a profile picture.

1. Click **"Upload a profile picture"**
2. Select your logo file (400x400px PNG)

## STEP 8 — SET YOUR PAGE USERNAME

Your username is what comes after facebook.com/. Example: facebook.com/humanledai

1. Look for **"Create @username"** under your page name on the left
2. Click it and type: `humanledai`
3. If that's taken, try: `humanledai.ai` or `humanledai.dfw`

## STEP 10 — SET YOUR CALL TO ACTION BUTTON

The CTA button shows up at the top of your page. This is the most valuable real estate on the page.

2. Choose **"Contact Us"** → then select **"Send message"** OR **"Learn More"**

4. If you choose "Book Now" — link it to your booking page (or humanledai.net for now)

**Recommended:** Set it to **"Book Now"** linking to `humanledai.net`

## STEP 11 — PIN A POST TO THE TOP

Your first post should be your intro. It will appear pinned at the top of your page.

**Write this post:**
```
