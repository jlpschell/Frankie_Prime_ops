# YouTube Channel Optimization Guide
## Human Led AI

**Estimated time:** 60–90 minutes (you're updating an existing channel, not starting from scratch)
**Difficulty:** Moderate — some of this requires the YouTube Studio dashboard

---

## WHAT YOU'LL NEED BEFORE STARTING

- [ ] Access to your existing YouTube channel (login to youtube.com with humanledai@gmail.com)
- [ ] Channel banner image (2560x1440px — see brand-assets-guide.md for safe zone dimensions)
- [ ] Channel icon/logo (800x800px)
- [ ] 10-15 minutes to write your channel description (it's in this guide — just paste it)

> **Note:** Your YouTube channel is tied to your Google Account. Since your Google account is humanledai@gmail.com, your YouTube and Google Business Profile live under the same account.

---

## STEP 1 — UPDATE YOUR CHANNEL NAME

1. Go to **youtube.com**
2. Click your profile picture (top right) → **"Your Channel"**
3. Click **"Customize channel"** (this opens YouTube Studio)
4. In Studio, go to **"Basic info"** tab
5. Find the **Channel name** field

**Set it to:**
```
Human Led AI
```

*(If it's already set to something similar, verify it matches exactly.)*

## STEP 2 — UPLOAD YOUR CHANNEL ICON

Your channel icon appears next to every video, every comment, and in search results. It needs to be your logo.

1. In **YouTube Studio** → **"Customization"** → **"Branding"** tab
2. Click **"Upload"** next to **"Profile picture"**
3. Upload your logo at 800x800px (or the highest resolution you have)
4. Click **Done** → **Publish**

---

## STEP 3 — UPLOAD YOUR CHANNEL BANNER

The banner is what people see when they visit your channel page.

**Safe zone reminder:** Banner uploads at 2560x1440px. Only the **center 1546x423px** is visible on all devices. Design accordingly.

**What your banner should include (in the safe zone):**
- Company name: **Human Led AI**
- Tagline: **"AI That Works While You Work"**
- Website: **humanledai.net**
- Keep it clean — navy background, white text, your logo

1. In **YouTube Studio** → **"Customization"** → **"Branding"** tab
2. Click **"Upload"** next to **"Banner image"**
3. Upload your 2560x1440px banner
4. Preview it in the three device views (TV/Desktop/Mobile) that YouTube shows you
5. Verify the center text is visible in all views
6. Click **Done** → **Publish**

---

## STEP 4 — ADD YOUR WATERMARK (VIDEO BRANDING)

A watermark is your logo that appears in the bottom-right corner of every video.

1. In **Branding** tab → scroll to **"Video watermark"**
2. Upload your logo at 150x150px (or YouTube will resize it)
3. Set display time: **"End of video"** (last 15-20 seconds) or **"Throughout video"**
4. Click **Done** → **Publish**

---

## STEP 5 — WRITE YOUR CHANNEL DESCRIPTION

1. In **YouTube Studio** → **"Customization"** → **"Basic info"** tab
2. Find the **"Description"** field

**Paste this:**
```

## STEP 7 — CREATE PLAYLISTS

Playlists organize your content and significantly improve watch time (YouTube's #1 ranking factor).

Create these playlists now (even if empty — add videos as you make them):

**Playlist 1:**
```
Name: How It Works — AI Answering for Contractors
Description: See exactly how Human Led AI answers contractor business calls, qualifies leads, and books appointments automatically. Live demos, walkthroughs, and real examples.
```

**Playlist 2:**
```
Name: The Missed Call Problem — What Contractors Don't Know

```

**Playlist 3:**
```

Description: Practical systems, tools, and strategies for contractors who want to grow their business without working more hours. Speed-to-lead, follow-up automation, and more.
```

**Playlist 4:**

```

**To create a playlist:**

3. Enter name + description
4. Set visibility to **"Public"**
5. Click **Create**

## STEP 8 — OPTIMIZE EXISTING VIDEOS (IF YOU HAVE ANY)

For every video already on your channel, update these three things:

### Title Formula (for contractor-targeted videos)
```
[Trade] + [Problem] + [Specific Number] + [Implied Solution]
```

**Examples:**
- "How DFW Roofers Stop Missing Storm Calls (Before the Next One Hits)"
- "Why Contractors Miss 50% of Calls — And What Fixes It"
- "47-Hour Callback Time Is Costing Contractors $18,000/Month — Here's the Fix"
- "Live Demo: AI Answering a Contractor's Phone (You'll Be Surprised)"

### Description Template (use for every video)
```
[First 2-3 sentences: what the video covers — IMPORTANT, this is what YouTube shows in search]

In this video:
→ [Timestamp 0:00] — [Topic]
→ [Timestamp 1:30] — [Topic]
→ [Timestamp 3:00] — [Topic]

---

If you're a contractor losing jobs because you can't answer every call, 
Human Led AI is the fix.

## STEP 9 — CREATE YOUR CHANNEL TRAILER

A Channel Trailer is the video that auto-plays for non-subscribers who visit your channel. This is your first impression.

**Target length:** 60-90 seconds
**Goal:** Get them to subscribe and book a demo

**Script outline:**
1. **Hook (0-5 sec):** "If you're a contractor and you're missing calls, this channel is for you."
2. **Problem (5-20 sec):** The 47-hour stat. The $18k/month missed revenue math.
3. **Solution (20-45 sec):** What Human Led AI does. Show a quick clip of the AI answering.
4. **Proof (45-70 sec):** What contractors experience after setup.
5. **CTA (70-90 sec):** "Subscribe for weekly tips. And if you want to see a live demo, link is in the description."

**To set your Channel Trailer:**
1. Upload the video
2. In **YouTube Studio** → **Customization** → **Layout** tab
3. Under **"Channel trailer for people who haven't subscribed"** → click **Add**
4. Select your trailer video
5. Click **Publish**

## STEP 10 — VIDEO SEO CHECKLIST (FOR EVERY VIDEO YOU UPLOAD)

Before hitting Publish, check all of these:

- [ ] **Title:** Includes main keyword + describes the value — under 60 characters
- [ ] **Description:** First 2-3 lines describe the video (these show in search), includes website link
- [ ] **Tags:** 10-15 relevant tags added
- [ ] **Thumbnail:** Custom thumbnail uploaded (1280x720px) — NOT YouTube's auto-generated one
- [ ] **Category:** Set to "How-to & Style" or "Education" or "Science & Technology"
- [ ] **Chapters:** Add timestamps in description if video is over 3 minutes
- [ ] **End screen:** Added (last 20 seconds) — promote another video + Subscribe button
- [ ] **Cards:** Add at relevant moments to link to your website or another video
- [ ] **Playlist:** Assigned to the right playlist

---

## STEP 11 — THUMBNAIL STRATEGY

Your thumbnail is MORE IMPORTANT than your title. People click the image first.

**What works:**
- Your face (if you're willing to be on camera) + bold text
- Split-screen: Problem on left ("MISSED CALL") → Solution on right ("BOOKED JOB ✓")
- Bold number in large font + short descriptor: **"$18,000/MONTH LOST"**
- Consistent color scheme (your brand colors) so your videos look like a series

**Create in Canva:** 1280x720px → search "YouTube thumbnail" → pick a bold template
