## RECOMMENDED TAGLINE

**"AI That Works While You Work"**

Why: It's the clearest value statement. It answers "what does it do?" in six words. Blue-collar friendly — it speaks the contractor's language. "Never Miss Another Call" is a strong secondary (use it in ad copy and headlines). "Your 24/7 AI Team Member" is good for LinkedIn/more corporate contexts.

**Use by context:**
- Primary everywhere: **"AI That Works While You Work"**
- Ad headlines / Google Posts: **"Never Miss Another Call"**
- LinkedIn / professional platforms: **"Your 24/7 AI Team Member"**

## LOGO / ICON CREATION TOOLS — RANKED FOR NON-DESIGNERS

### 🥇 1. Canva (canva.com) — START HERE
**Best overall.** Free tier is plenty. Reasons:
- Has a Logo Maker built in (search "logo" in templates)
- Brand Kit stores your colors + fonts so everything matches automatically
- **Magic Resize** — design once, resize for every platform in one click
- Easiest to use, most tutorials online, nothing to install
- Free tier covers 90% of what you need

**How to start:** canva.com → Create a design → Logo → search "technology" or "AI" or "business"

---

### 🥈 2. Looka (looka.com) — Best if you want a polished brand kit fast
- AI generates 50+ logo options in 2 minutes based on your industry + colors
- Gives you full brand kit: logo variations, color codes, font names
- **Paid** (~$65 one-time for full files) — worth it if you want professional PNG/SVG files
- Best option if you want to skip the DIY and just get a clean result

**How to start:** looka.com → Enter "Human Led AI" → pick Blue + Dark Navy → choose "technology" style

---

### 🥉 3. Hatchful by Shopify (hatchful.shopify.com) — Free, fast, good enough
- Completely free, no account required
- Fewer options than Looka but gets you a usable logo in under 10 minutes
- Good for getting started while you decide on final branding

---

### 4. Brandmark.io — Most polished AI output, small cost

- $25-$65 one-time depending on files you need
- Good if Looka feels overwhelming

## COLOR PALETTE

### Primary Colors

| Color | Name | Hex Code | Use For |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| 🔵 | Deep Navy | `#1A2E5A` | Primary backgrounds, headers, profile banners |
| 🔵 | Electric Blue | `#2563EB` | Buttons, accents, highlights, icons |
| ⚪ | Clean White | `#FFFFFF` | Text on dark backgrounds, clean space |
| ⚫ | Charcoal | `#1F2937` | Body text, dark elements |
| 🟡 | Amber Accent | `#F59E0B` | CTAs, "book a demo" buttons, urgency elements |

### Why This Palette
- **Deep Navy + Electric Blue** = trustworthy, professional, tech-forward. Think IBM, Salesforce, LinkedIn — all use blue for exactly this reason.
- **Amber accent** = action. This is your "book now" color. It pops against blue without screaming.
- Blue-collar friendly: not trendy, not fragile. It reads as competent and reliable.

### Secondary (use sparingly)
- Light Blue: `#DBEAFE` — backgrounds, card fills, very light use
- Slate Gray: `#64748B` — secondary text, captions

---

## FONT PAIRING

### Recommended (both free on Google Fonts)

**Headlines / Display:** `Inter Bold` or `Montserrat Bold`
- Clean, modern, highly readable at any size
- Works on every platform
- Used by thousands of SaaS and professional service companies

**Body / Secondary:** `Inter Regular` or `Open Sans Regular`
- Pairs naturally with the headline font
- Extremely readable on mobile

### In Canva: 
Search "Montserrat" for headlines, "Open Sans" or "Inter" for body. Set these in your Brand Kit so they auto-apply.

### Do NOT use:
- Papyrus, Comic Sans, anything that looks handwritten
- More than 2 fonts total — ever

---

## LOGO DESIGN RULES

### The One Icon Principle
Design ONE icon/logo that works at every size. Do NOT create different logos for different platforms. Your logo must work:
- At 16x16px (favicon — tiny, needs to be simple)
- At 180x180px (profile picture)
- At full banner width

**What works at small sizes:** A single letter, a simple geometric shape, or a minimal icon. An "H" with a circuit/wave element. A person silhouette + signal waves. Keep it simple.

### File Formats to Download
When you finalize your logo, export these versions:
- **PNG transparent background** — for profile pictures, website
- **PNG white background** — for documents
- **JPG** — for banners and covers
- **SVG** (if available) — scalable, never blurry

### Logo Don'ts
- ❌ Don't stretch it — ever
- ❌ Don't put it on a busy background
- ❌ Don't use a color that disappears on white or dark backgrounds
- ❌ Don't add drop shadows or gradients in the first version — keep it flat and clean

## PLATFORM IMAGE DIMENSIONS — MASTER REFERENCE

### FACEBOOK BUSINESS PAGE

| Asset | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Profile Picture | **170x170px** (displays as 170x170 on desktop, 36x36 on mobile) | Upload at 400x400 for quality. Will be cropped to circle. |
| Cover Photo | **820x312px** (desktop) / **640x360px** (mobile safe zone) | Design at 820x462px, keep important content in center 640x312 |
| Shared Post Image | **1200x630px** | Standard social share size |
| Story | **1080x1920px** | 9:16 vertical |
| Event Cover | **1920x1005px** | |

**Canva template searches:** "Facebook Cover", "Facebook Business Page Cover"

---

### LINKEDIN COMPANY PAGE

| Asset | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Logo (Profile) | **300x300px** minimum | Square, displays small — keep icon simple |
| Banner / Cover Image | **1128x191px** | Very wide, very short. Use bold text + minimal design. |
| Shared Post Image | **1200x627px** | Nearly identical to Facebook post size |
| Life Tab Background | **1128x376px** | |

**Banner tip:** At 1128x191, your banner is very narrow. Keep text to 2-3 words max or use a graphic element. "AI That Works While You Work" in white on Navy works perfectly here.

---

### INSTAGRAM BUSINESS

| Asset | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Profile Picture | **320x320px** (displays at 110x110) | Upload at 400x400. Cropped to circle. |
| Square Post | **1080x1080px** | Standard grid post |
| Portrait Post | **1080x1350px** | Takes up more screen space — better engagement |
| Landscape Post | **1080x566px** | |
| Story / Reel | **1080x1920px** | 9:16 vertical — keep text away from top/bottom 250px |
| Highlight Cover | **1080x1920px** (only center circle shows) | |

**Note:** Instagram is a visual platform. Invest time here — your grid is your first impression.

---

### TIKTOK BUSINESS

| Asset | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Profile Picture | **200x200px** minimum | Cropped to circle on mobile |
| Video | **1080x1920px** | 9:16 vertical — this is the only content format that matters |
| Profile Banner (web only) | **1500x500px** | Not visible in the app — low priority |

**TikTok reality check:** Profile image matters less. Your FIRST VIDEO is your real "profile." Make it count.

---

### YOUTUBE CHANNEL

| Asset | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Profile Picture | **800x800px** | Cropped to circle. Same as Google account avatar. |
| Channel Art / Banner | **2560x1440px** (upload size) | Safe zone for all devices: **1546x423px** center. Design for center, not edges. |
| Video Thumbnail | **1280x720px** | 16:9. This matters more than anything else for YouTube growth. |
| Channel Icon | **800x800px** | Same as profile picture |
| End Screen Elements | **1920x1080px** | |

**Channel Art device breakdown:**
- TV: full 2560x1440px
- Desktop: 2560x423px wide strip
- Tablet: 1855x423px
- Mobile: only sees 1546x423px center

→ Design your banner so the critical message fits in the **center 1546x423px** safe zone. Everything outside is bonus.

### GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE

| Asset | Dimensions | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Logo | **250x250px** minimum | Square. Displays in search results and Maps. |
| Cover Photo | **1080x608px** (16:9 recommended) | First photo shown in your listing |
| Additional Photos | **720x720px** minimum | Product, service, team shots |
| Video | **1920x1080px**, 30 seconds max | Supported but rarely used by small businesses |

**GBP photo priority order:**
1. Logo (gets shown next to your business name in Maps)
2. Cover photo (first thing people see when they tap your listing)
3. Additional photos of "your work" — for contractors, before/after job photos perform well
