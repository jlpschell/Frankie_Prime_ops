# EMAIL 1 — Day 0: Pattern Interrupt

### Subject Lines (pick one):
- **A:** How many calls did you miss this week?
- **B:** Quick question about your phone
- **C:** You lost 3 jobs this week and don't know it

---

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Real question — how many calls went to voicemail this week while you were on a job?

Most contractors miss 40-60% of incoming calls. Each one is a $500-$5,000 job walking straight to your competitor.

We built an AI system that answers every call in your business name, 24/7. Books the appointment. Follows up on leads automatically.

Worth a 5-minute look?

# EMAIL 2 — Day 3: Value / Proof

### Subject Lines (pick one):
- **A:** What happened when a roofer stopped missing calls
- **B:** From 40% answer rate to 100% (here's how)
- **C:** The $72,000 leak in your business

---

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Fun stat: the average contractor takes 47 hours to call back a lead.

Leads contacted in under 5 minutes convert 21x more.

One HVAC company we set up went from answering 3 out of 10 calls to catching every single one — nights, weekends, all of it. Booked 14 extra jobs in the first month.

We do the full setup. You just show up to the jobs.

# EMAIL 3 — Day 7: Direct CTA

### Subject Lines (pick one):
- **A:** 5 minutes. See it answer YOUR phone live.
- **B:** Last email — wanted to show you something real quick
- **C:** I'll call your number right now if you want

---

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Last one from me.

Book a 5-minute demo — I'll dial your business number live so you can hear exactly how the AI answers, what it asks, and how it books an appointment.

No slides. No pitch deck. Just a phone call that turns into a booked job.

If it's not a fit, no hard feelings. But if it is — you'll wonder why you waited.
