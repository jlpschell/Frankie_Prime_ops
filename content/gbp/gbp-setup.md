## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (GBP Q&A — Add These Yourself)

**Q: Does the AI actually sound like a real person?**
A: Yes. We customize the voice, script, and responses for your specific business. Most callers have no idea they're talking to an AI — they just know someone professional answered the phone. Book a demo at humanledai.net and hear it yourself.

**Q: How long does setup take?**
A: Most contractors are live within 5-7 business days. We handle the full setup — you don't need to be tech-savvy. You just tell us your business, services, and schedule, and we build it out.

**Q: What trades do you work with?**
A: Roofing, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, landscaping, concrete, fence, garage door, painting — any contractor business that relies on inbound calls and appointments. If your phone drives your revenue, we can help.

**Q: What does it cost?**
A: Pricing depends on your call volume and services needed. It's significantly less than a full-time receptionist ($35,000-$45,000/yr) and works 24/7 including nights and weekends. Contact us for a quote: [PHONE] or humanledai@gmail.com.

**Q: Can it handle emergency calls?**
A: Yes. The system is trained to identify urgent calls (burst pipe, AC down in summer, emergency electrical) and flag them immediately with a text notification to you. You decide how to respond — the system captures and qualifies every call regardless.

**Q: Do you serve contractors outside of DFW?**
A: We're based in DFW and built this for the North Texas market, but we work with contractors across Texas. Call us at [PHONE] to discuss your area.

**Q: What if I already have a receptionist or answering service?**
A: Our system works alongside human staff or completely replaces after-hours and overflow coverage. Many contractors use us for nights/weekends when their staff isn't available.

### POST 1 — Intro / What We Do

**Title:** DFW Contractors: Stop Losing Jobs to Missed Calls

**Body:**
If you're a contractor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, you're probably missing 40-60% of your incoming calls. Not because you're not working hard — because you're ON the job.

Every missed call is a $500-$5,000 job that went to your competitor.

Human Led AI gives your business an AI-powered answering system that picks up every call, 24/7, in your business name. It qualifies the lead, books the appointment, and follows up automatically on leads that didn't book.

No receptionist to hire. No call center. Setup in under a week.

### POST 2 — Speed-to-Lead Education

**Title:** 47 Hours vs. 2 Minutes — Which Contractor Wins?

**Body:**
The average contractor takes 47 hours to call back a new lead.

Leads contacted within 5 minutes convert 21x more than those contacted after 30 minutes.

If you're calling people back the next day, you're not in the game. The job was already decided.

Human Led AI responds to new leads in under 2 minutes — automatically. Texts, emails, and follow-up sequences that run without you touching a thing.

Roofing, HVAC, plumbing, electrical, landscaping, concrete, fence, painting — we built this for contractors.

### POST 3 — Trade-Specific (Rotate by Trade)

**Title:** DFW Roofers: Hail Season Is Coming. Is Your Phone Ready?

**Body:**
When a hail storm hits North Texas, your phone lights up.

The problem? You're on a roof. Your crew's on a job. Calls are going to voicemail.

Your competitor just answered three calls you missed.

Human Led AI answers every storm lead — nights, weekends, during jobs. It asks the right questions, books the inspection, and notifies you instantly.

You focus on roofs. We handle the phones.

### POST 4 — ROI / Math Post

**Title:** The Real Cost of Missed Calls for DFW Contractors

**Body:**
Here's a quick calculation:

→ Average contractor job value: $1,500
→ Calls missed per week: 10
→ Estimated real leads: 30% = 3 jobs
→ Revenue missed per week: $4,500
→ Revenue missed per month: $18,000

Most contractors who do this math immediately want a demo.

Human Led AI captures every call, follows up on every lead, and books appointments automatically — 24/7.
