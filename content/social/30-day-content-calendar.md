## WEEK 1 — Launch / Awareness

---

### DAY 1 — Pain Point
**Type:** Pain point

**Post Text:**
Contractors in DFW miss 40-60% of their incoming calls.

Not because they're bad at business.

Because they're ON the job.

Every unanswered call is a $500-$5,000 job going to your competitor.

We fixed that.

**Image/Video:** Bold text graphic on dark background. Large stat "40-60%" in bright orange. Subtext: "of contractor calls go unanswered." Human Led AI logo bottom right.

### DAY 2 — Educational
**Type:** Educational

**Post Text:**
Speed-to-lead is everything in the trades.

Lead called at 8am.
You call back at 3pm.
They hired someone at 9am.

Leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert.

Twenty-one times.

Your follow-up system needs to move faster than you can.

**Image/Video:** Split graphic: Left side "Your competitor called back in 4 min." / Right side "You called back in 4 hours." Simple, clean, high contrast.

### DAY 3 — Behind the Scenes
**Type:** Behind the scenes

**Post Text:**
Here's what happens when a contractor uses Human Led AI:

🔔 Phone rings at 9pm (homeowner's AC is out)
⚡ AI picks up on ring 1, in the company name
📋 Asks the right questions, gets the details
📅 Books the service call for next morning
📲 Tech gets a text: "New job booked. Here's the info."

Owner never touched his phone.

That's the point.

**Image/Video:** Short screen recording or animated graphic showing the flow: Call In → AI Answers → Lead Qualified → Appointment Booked → Owner Notified. Clean step-by-step animation.

Your phone blew up this morning.

You were on a roof.

How many of those calls did you catch?

Storm season is short. Missed calls don't come back.

### DAY 6 — Educational
**Type:** Educational

**Post Text:**
The average contractor takes 47 hours to call back a new lead.

This isn't a hustle problem.
This is a systems problem.

Fix the system, not your schedule.

### DAY 8 — Educational
**Type:** Educational

**Post Text:**
3 things killing your contractor lead pipeline:

1. Calls going to voicemail
2. Following up too slow
3. No system for leads who didn't book the first time

Every one of these is fixable.
None of them require you to work more hours.

3am. Pipe burst. Homeowner is panicking.

How does the AI know what to say?

It sounds like a professional who knows your company.

Setup takes less than a week.

**Post Text:**
What happens to leads who call after 5pm?

Most contractor businesses: voicemail.

Are you capturing them?

**Type:** Pain point

**Post Text:**
Spring is here. Every homeowner in DFW wants their yard done NOW.

Your landscaping company is booked for 3 weeks.

Your phone's still ringing with people who want to schedule.

You're not answering. They're finding someone who will.

Don't lose February bookings in March because of a missed call.

### DAY 20 — Educational
**Type:** Educational

**Post Text:**
Why do contractors lose to competitors who do WORSE work?

That's the whole system.

Fence and concrete jobs in DFW are big tickets.

$3,000 fence. $5,000 driveway. $8,000 patio and retaining wall.
