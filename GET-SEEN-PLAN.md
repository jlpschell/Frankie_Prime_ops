# GET SEEN — Human Led AI Visibility Plan

## Current State
- Website: humanledai.net (basic, no traffic)
- Phone number: exists
- Email: exists
- GHL: 738 contacts, 519 mobile-verified (blocked by A2P)
- 6,396 leads in CSVs
- Zero online presence, zero inbound

## The Problem
Nobody knows we exist. We have leads but can't reach them (A2P pending). We have a website but no traffic. We have no social presence.

---

## Phase 1: IMMEDIATE (This Week — $0 Cost)

### 1. Google Business Profile
- Create/claim GBP for "Human Led AI" in Royse City/DFW area
- Category: "Technology Company" or "Business Consulting"
- This alone puts us on Google Maps and local search
- **Frankie can draft all content, Jay just needs to verify via postcard/phone**

### 2. Website SEO Overhaul
- Current site is a single page with opt-in — no content = no Google ranking
- Add 5-10 service pages targeting DFW contractor keywords:
  - "AI answering service for roofers DFW"
  - "Automated lead follow-up for HVAC companies"
  - "AI receptionist for plumbers Dallas"
  - "Miss no calls contractor AI Texas"
- Add schema markup, meta descriptions, sitemap
- **Frankie builds all pages, deploys to Netlify**

### 3. Social Media Presence
- Create/activate accounts: LinkedIn (company page), Facebook Business, X/Twitter
- Post 3x/week: short demos, before/after stories, contractor pain points
- **Frankie can draft all content, schedule via buffer/manual**

### 4. GenX WealthStack Cross-Pollination
- Jay already has this social brand — use it to introduce Human Led AI
- "Here's what I'm building for contractors" posts

---

## Phase 2: QUICK WINS (Next 2 Weeks)

### 5. Cold Email Campaign (No A2P needed)
- Use the 6,396 leads with verified emails
- 3-email sequence:
  1. "Do you know how many calls you miss per week?"
  2. Case study / demo video
  3. "Let me show you in 5 minutes"
- Tools: Instantly.ai or Lemlist (free tiers available)
- **Frankie writes all copy, sets up sequences**

### 6. Demo Videos (VM Scripts Ready)
- We have 27 scripts across 9 niches
- Render audio via ElevenLabs → create audiogram/video demos
- Post on YouTube, LinkedIn, embed on website
- **Blocked on: Jay reviewing scripts, ElevenLabs API key fix**

### 7. Local DFW Contractor Groups
- Join Facebook groups: DFW Contractors, Royse City Business, etc.
- Provide value first (answer questions about AI), then soft-pitch
- **Jay does this manually — Frankie drafts responses**

---

## Phase 3: SCALE (Weeks 3-4)

### 8. Google Ads (Small Budget)
- Target: "AI answering service" + DFW geo
- $10-20/day test budget
- Landing page: specific to each niche
- **Needs Jay's approval on spend**

### 9. Referral / Partner Program
- Reach out to GHL agencies, contractor coaches, business consultants
- Offer commission or white-label deal
- **Frankie researches and drafts outreach**

### 10. A2P Goes Live (When Approved)
- 519 mobile-verified contacts get SMS campaign
- "You filled out our form — here's your free AI demo"
- **Everything is prepped, just waiting on carrier approval**
