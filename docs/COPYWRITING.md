### Email Template
```
Subject: {FirstName}, quick question about {City} leads

Hey {FirstName},

Saw {CompanyName} is crushing it in {City}. Those Google reviews speak for themselves.

Here's the thing — most contractors lose 40% of their leads because no one picks up after hours. You're on the roof, you can't answer every call.

We built a voice AI that answers like a real person, books appointments, and texts you the details. It's like hiring a receptionist who never sleeps.

I've been in construction and insurance for 20 years — I get how getting your time back is a nice perk.

Worth a quick call this week?

— Jay

Hey {FirstName},

I've reached out a couple times about helping {CompanyName} capture more leads. No response, so I'm guessing the timing's off.
