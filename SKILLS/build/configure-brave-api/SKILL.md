# Configure Brave Search API Key

This guide will walk you through setting up your Brave Search API key so Frankie can perform web searches.

## Setup Steps

**Step 1: Open your terminal and run the configuration command.**

Copy and paste the following command into your terminal and press Enter:

```bash
openclaw configure --section web
```

**Step 2: Enter your Brave Search API key.**

The terminal will prompt you to enter the `BRAVE_API_KEY`. Paste the API key you provided:

`BSA4giAcu16dSbFlSU38lrSBpHZZ-wY`

Then, press Enter.

**Step 3: Confirm the configuration is saved.**

OpenClaw should confirm that the configuration has been saved.

Once you've completed these steps, please let me know, and I can then perform web searches for your GHL request.
