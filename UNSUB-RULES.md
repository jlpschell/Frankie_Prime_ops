## Auto-Unsubscribe Triggers
- Sender has sent 4+ emails in 7 days with 0 opens
- Subject line contains: "limited time", "act now", "last chance", "don't miss" AND sender is not protected
- Sender domain matches known marketing platforms AND Jay has never replied to them
- check wih Jay with list for certainty.
- move unsub to trash and notify jay at briefing.

## Verification
- After unsubscribe, monitor for 48 hours
- If emails stop: mark as verified
- If emails continue: alert Jay, mark as failed-verification

## Safety Rails
- First 5 auto-unsubs: individual Discord notifications
- After 5: batch into summary
- Full audit trail in unsub-log.json
