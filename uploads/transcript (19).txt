Transcript:
(00:00) AI is everywhere. So, today I&#39;m going to show you how to build a full website in 30 seconds. I&#39;m talking click a button, [music] typed in a prompt, and the whole thing&#39;s done. But here&#39;s what nobody&#39;s actually telling you. How do you actually turn this into a real business that pays monthly [music] recurring revenue? I&#39;ll show you how to find real clients that need the service.
(00:16)  And then I will even show you a live cold call of me calling one of these people up and actually selling this. [music] And most importantly, I will show you how to charge these clients on a monthly recurring basis. Okay, look, first thing we have here is the planning phase. This is what you need to do.
(00:31)  You need to pick a niche so that your life becomes easier. I promise you, as you get more clients, as you cross $5,000 a month or $10,000 a month to not hate your life. You need to work with one industry. In the beginning, it&#39;s fine if you have multiple if you need the cash. But my recommendation is contractors. These guys can build houses, but they certainly cannot build anything website or techreated.
(00:53)  So, they work perfectly for this service. I&#39;m talking remodelers, roofers, plumbers, house painters. I have this entire spreadsheet, which I can link up in the description, of niches that you can actually go after, but even these random ones like pest control absolutely crush. Next is going to be lead generation and outreach.
(01:10)  So, we need to find businesses on Google Maps, okay? And I found a free Chrome extension to really maximize your time and make you the most efficient that you can possibly be. Let&#39;s search the Las Vegas area since I used to live there. I typed in landscaping Las Vegas. You can go ahead and hit search. Boom. Now it shows a bunch of these landscapers.
(01:29)  So this right here is the plugin. It&#39;s actually in beta. So this plugin isn&#39;t even out yet. I was able to get early access, but once this comes out, I&#39;ll link it down below as well. Um, and this is how it looks right here. So once you&#39;re on the page, you would just hit extract business data. And what it&#39;s going to do is it will scroll down through all of these businesses and generate you a list that looks like this.
(01:51)  This is a previous one that I generated. It&#39;ll put that business name, the phone number, the address, all of this. The Google Maps URL, right? What&#39;s the rating, what&#39;s the review count, all nicely inside of one sheet. And then once you have this list, you can categorize it by people that don&#39;t have websites right here.
(02:06)  So, they have nothing linked. Guess what? You can reach out to them and tell them something like this. Are you still open? Your website said closed for some reason. I actually built you a new one. Do you want to see it? Now again, some of these people do have websites, but they just don&#39;t link it to their Google page. This is what I found.
(02:24)  And this works extremely well because you don&#39;t actually have to build anything up front. What we&#39;re going to do is put together a template for their industry. Again, this is where niching comes into play. And now when they jump on a demo call with you, you show them that templated website.
(02:39)  And hey, if they want to make changes, great. But now they have to pay your service and they can customize it to their business. You can also say something like this. Hey, are you guys still open? I&#39;m actually a student just messing around with new technology and I built you a talking website and it&#39;s ready to book appointments.
(02:54)  Is it cool if I show you? Now, if you&#39;re wondering what exactly is a talking website, I will show you exactly what that looks like. This is how we build these websites all with AI. We use one software. It&#39;s called Go Free Trial. I&#39;ve tested a whole bunch of other ones and for everything that we offer like that talking website model, everything is inside of this one software.
(03:14)  So, for example, this is what makes it a talking website. This is one of our templates. This is actually a uh a live client. And this is a conversation that I had. I first typed in testing. This is Pavle. I said, &quot;Hey, Pavle, you&#39;re looking to book a phone call consultation. I&#39;m happy to help. Want to get started?&quot; And then I asked, &quot;What services do you provide?&quot; Essentially, what this little chat widget does is it goes through all their pages, right? It reads all their service pages. It reads their contact us page,
(03:37) about us page. It learns everything it can about this business. Then you link up your client&#39;s calendar to this little chat widget and it automatically books them appointments. So now instead of your client receiving website forms, they&#39;re waking up in the morning and they already have appointments on their calendar that AI already booked.
(03:53)  Now if you want to be slightly more advanced, what you can do is actually integrate voice AI into this chat widget. This is another website template that we have. And then what you can do is click call us here and it will start a live conversation with AI that read all of the pages. So all of their location pages, all their services pages, it will learn everything about this business and the website visitor can have a voice conversation with this website instead of trying to search through all these different pages. Now look, I don&#39;t want
(04:19) to overwhelm you, but you can build this very, very easily. Now, when it comes to building these websites, there&#39;s a few things you could do. You can just head over towards this new website. You can choose from the templates and truth is they have a lot of really really beautiful templates already built right here.
(04:34)  So just take one and almost all niches are already in here and just put the clients a logo at the top and now you can show it to them of hey this is the sample homepage that I built you and this is a great place to start to show you some samples. This is one of our templated websites. Here we have another. Here we have another. So here we have a plumbing template.
(04:51)  Here we have a roofing template. I actually really love this one right here. And then we have this concrete one as well. If you want everything imported into your account and just copy and paste everything that we&#39;ve built with a click, you can now do that. It&#39;s working like crazy.
(05:06)  Not just for me, but we&#39;ve proven that this works for people with all kinds of experience levels and backgrounds. In fact, Gohigh Level themselves rated us the number one course because of the results that we get for people and the support that we give. I&#39;m going to show you a toz how to get clients, deliver results, grow your business, and then even hire employees to run it all for you.
(05:26)  I&#39;ll even talk to you on Zoom and answer questions to make sure that you succeed. If you want all this for free, go to laptopeo.com or check the link in the description. Now, look, maybe you found some website on the internet that you absolutely love and you don&#39;t want to copy it, but you want to take inspiration from it.
(05:42)  I&#39;m going to show you as well how you can do that. There&#39;s this little plugin that I found. Again, this one is also in beta. It&#39;s by the same company, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s out yet. But essentially, what you can do is copy this website right here. You can head over to your dashboard and let&#39;s say I&#39;m starting a new website.
(05:59)  We&#39;ll call it test right here. And you can actually take someone else&#39;s website and paste it into your own account. And this is how it works. As you can see, this is a blank page. It&#39;s called test. And I would just go in here and I would hit paste copied funnel. And then it is loading up. So let&#39;s see how well it did. Okay. Nice.
(06:17) So I just went from here. This is the site. Boom. And now all these are editable. Just like that. And now you have their entire website. Again, make sure you change this up. Don&#39;t go out on the internet and just start copying people&#39;s Okay. So, let&#39;s talk about website content. How can we actually build this website content and make it look good, make it sound good.
(06:36) This is what I like to do. I have a GPT bot. You can check it out right there. It&#39;s completely free. You don&#39;t need to give me your email or anything else like that. It&#39;ll redirect you to a page that looks like this. And all you want to do is just paste in a screenshot of your website template.
(06:49)  Just paste in your client&#39;s details. This is a sample client. and it will literally give you all the content. I&#39;ve already trained it. We use this internally for our website content, so I know it&#39;s good. Boom. Now, it writes to you the whole thing. It will read what section is where and it will give you content for that section, right? Why choose ABC landscaping and so forth.
(07:06)  Like there&#39;s bullet points inside of our template right there as you can see or icons rather. So, you would take this content and just simply paste it in and it does that for the entire website. You can also use this to generate images. So, everything is very easy. My recommendation, use one generic niche template to actually show your clients.
(07:25) Don&#39;t build one. And then once they want something custom, then you go in and use these tools and actually build them something. All right, let&#39;s talk about closing the deal and pricing. Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Hi, this is Logan. Uh, sorry, I need to call. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
(07:43)  You you broke up there a little bit. This is You said this is Logan Drywall. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I think I called you like 20 minutes ago, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. And I&#39;m assuming you guys are still open cuz it did say closed when I tried to look you up. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it&#39;s kind of weird.
(08:02) &gt;&gt; Oh, huh? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know. &gt;&gt; That&#39;s odd. Okay. Um, well, look, I I actually built you guys a talking website and it&#39;s all ready and set up. Is that something you would even want? A website? No, we already have one. &gt;&gt; No, no, it&#39;s a talking website. &gt;&gt; Like a smart website.
(08:23) &gt;&gt; Talking website. &gt;&gt; Like a super smart talking website. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. So, [laughter] freak. Um, can you send me a sample or a sample or something? &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. I mean, look, it&#39;s already done, so I can send you like what I have. Um, the thing is I I I don&#39;t have it live on the internet, so I can&#39;t just send you a link, but if you want, I can show it to you.
(08:59)  So, if you&#39;re available, we can do a Zoom call and I&#39;ll just show you what I have. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Um, I can&#39;t do video call right now because I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m driving right now to a meeting. &gt;&gt; Nice. &gt;&gt; With the um uh the restoration, but um I&#39;m going to be free around 6. &gt;&gt; Okay. You want to do 6 p.m.
(09:27)  today? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, I&#39;m down. I actually can&#39;t do right now either. Uh I can do 6 PM though. So, what&#39;s uh I&#39;ll send you the the meeting link. Um, what is your best email? I&#39;ll just send it there. &gt;&gt; Uh, is &gt;&gt; uh, uh, Gmail. &gt;&gt; A Gmail. Okay, gotcha. Cool. All right, man.
(09:56)  And what what was your name, by the way? I didn&#39;t catch that. &gt;&gt; My name is Julio. &gt;&gt; Julio. Okay. Bueno. Yeah, I only speak a little bit. That&#39;s that&#39;s basically all that I know. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I know it sounded good and I sound like I could be Latin, but I&#39;m that&#39;s that&#39;s really about it.
(10:19) &gt;&gt; So Oh, man. &gt;&gt; All right, man. My My name is Paul, by the way. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Paul. &gt;&gt; Paul. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Paul. Paul. Like sometimes if I go to Latin America, then they call me uh Pablo. So you can say that, too. &gt;&gt; Pablo. &gt;&gt; There you go. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cool. All right, brother.
(10:36)  Well, sounds good, man. I will uh I&#39;ll speak to you at 6. All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Perfect. All good. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Cool. All right, brother. See you later. So, we have two options. One is going to be the beginner route. One&#39;s going to be the high ticket route. Now, when I say beginner route, I don&#39;t actually mean that advanced people can&#39;t do this because you can certainly grow your business just with this first option.
(10:54) But if you are a beginner, definitely definitely stick to this. And that is going to be a free website build. So, you offer them, hey, this website&#39;s completely free, but you have to pay $300 per month for using our GoHighle software access. You&#39;re paying for the system that actually makes them money, not just hosting because we tack on a bunch of stuff with this.
(11:14)  And if you&#39;re wondering, well, what exactly do we give them? I&#39;ll show you that in a second. Let me first break down this pricing right here, which is going to be the high ticket route. So look, if you are an actual web designer, you have web design experience, you can sell these websites for $3,000, 45, $6,000 upfront.
(11:30) This is what I used to do. Then you can still do that. Charge them thousands of dollars because of your unique design. Maybe you even build them somewhere else. Just integrate it with GoHigh Lee to use the features that I&#39;m going to tell you about. And then you just charge $300 per month for continued software access.
(11:48)  So why do they keep paying us every single month? Let&#39;s go into that. What does a monthly recurring look like on this? The first thing you want to do is obviously connect their domain to go high level. This is very easy to do. All you do is head over to where it says settings right here. You would hit domains and then again if you want to purchase a new one could do that.
(12:04)  You can also transfer a domain inside of here or you can just link it under external domains. You just hit connect domains and it&#39;s going to give you the records that you can paste in. Next thing is each client gets a sub account and you can have unlimited for the same price that you pay to go high level.
(12:20)  So whether you have a,000 clients that are paying you $300 a month or 500 clients or 100 clients or 50 clients or one client, you are paying go high level the same $300 per month. And that is the beauty of this entire model is as soon as you get your first client, you are profitable. And these are all the different sub accounts.
(12:38)  It&#39;s going to appear up here. Now I have to blur all this because these are my actual clients in here. But as you can see, I am scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and then it&#39;s still loading and then I&#39;m scrolling and all of these clients are on here. They get their own account. They get their own login.
(12:53)  This is my logo at the top here. So, they&#39;re logging into my software. And that&#39;s the best part because now your clients get way more than just hosting if that&#39;s what you&#39;re used to selling. So, what are they actually getting, right? They get this whether you call it a smart website or a talking website or just in general you&#39;re still doing solely web design. That&#39;s fine.
(13:11)  you can offer that to them for free unless you&#39;re doing custom sites. And then what they pay for is the back-end autoresponder and the Google reviews. So, you&#39;re wondering, how does that even work? This is the backend autoresponder. Look, what do clients really want? Do they care about a website or do they care about getting more customers, more clients? That is it right there.
(13:31)  What happens to someone when they fill out a form on your website that you actually built them? When do they follow up with their clients? Well, oftentimes it&#39;s not fast enough or they just don&#39;t follow up because that email goes to spam. So, what we do is we automatically text and email those people that fill out the website form on our clients behalf.
(13:54)  And all you have to do is just integrate it right here. And then you can have smarter automations that ask, did they reply to the SMS? Yes. No. Okay, they did reply. Was it positive? Was it negative? Oh, it was positive. Send them a booking link. So now that person can book automatically from these automations and maximize the amount of money that they&#39;re making from this website that you built them.
(14:16)  Okay, it was negative. Okay, let&#39;s notify the client. Hey, Mr. client, this person said something negative. Okay, they didn&#39;t reply. Let&#39;s try to manually call them and the client, right? Let&#39;s automatically drop them a voicemail. Your client records a voicemail one time.
(14:30)  If they don&#39;t respond to your text, it automatically places that voicemail in that person&#39;s inbox without the client ever doing anything. So, we are maximizing the chances of them actually making money from their website. Next is Google reviews. What does that look like? A lot of clients are just too freaking scared to ask for Google reviews.
(14:48)  It&#39;s because they fear getting a negative rating. This helps with all of that. We tell them, &quot;Hey, rate us right here.&quot; If they select five stars, then it automatically sends to Google. If your client&#39;s customer selects one star, it pops up this form and says, &quot;Sorry to hear that you&#39;re not satisfied. Name, email, your feedback.
(15:06) &quot; Boom. And now it just lands in their inbox. So every new client that comes in, we automatically send this via text message and via email to all their customers and they can go from 10 reviews to like 50 reviews in the first two weeks of us working together. So what happens? Their Google listing gets boosted.
(15:24)  The reputation gets built and then we integrate those reviews in their website as well. And so now their business is much more reputable and much better on all accounts. And by now, hopefully, you&#39;re starting to see the benefit because a lot of these clients, they make thousands of dollars per customer that they sign up. So, if you save them one customer every few months, the service still pays for itself and they are happy to keep on paying you.
(15:44) Never focus on features, right? Focus on don&#39;t show them all the stuff I&#39;m showing you, but focus on the end outcome. Hey, remember, we&#39;re going to follow up with all your leads and you will get more appointments, you will get more sales from this system. Lastly, what I want to cover is the mobile app.
(15:58) So, this is what we install for each client. We get them to do this on their phone and this links up directly with your GoHigh level account and all they see is just their sub account like I showed you. And now all their appointments that you&#39;re getting them from their website, right? All the leads, all the opportunities, all the conversations they&#39;re having are now happening inside of this one app.
(16:20)  So, you want to train your clients to check this app, to use this app as much as humanly possible because this is why they keep paying you every [clears throat] single month. They don&#39;t want to see this freaking back end, okay? They want to just be on their phone when they&#39;re driving, when they&#39;re working.
(16:34)  They want to be able to check it real quick and see, hey, how many appointments do we have, right? How many leads did we actually generate? This is why they keep paying you every single month, because their leads keep popping in here. So, look, if you want to watch me cold call and actually get clients live, I&#39;m going to link up this video for you
