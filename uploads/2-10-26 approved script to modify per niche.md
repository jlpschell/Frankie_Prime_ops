"Hey there, this is Jason. I was doing some research on roofing companies in the DFW area and came across yours. Most roofing owners I speak with are either slammed one month and then slow the next - never really consistent, you know? I can fix that problem and  prove to you we'll get  25% more jobs on your schedule in the next 45 days. If you want a free breakdown of how to fill your calendar year-round, give me a call, or a quick text asking for more info and I'll put something together specifically for your business, completely free. Talk to you soon!"

"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just looking into roofing companies in the DFW area and found yours. I just helped some other Roofer's  increase their monthly jobs by 25% in like 45 days... without them lifting a finger. So if you want me to walk you through how we did it and build something custom for your business at no cost, just give me a call back or shoot me a text for more info. Talk to you soon!"

Hey there, this is Jason. I was just doing some research on roofing companies in the  DFW area and came across yours. I recently worked with another roofing company - they were pretty much relying only on referrals, and so we got them to like 25% more jobs every month. And it's completely on autopilot now. They don't even think about it. So anyway, if you want me to walk you through exactly how we pulled that off, I can put together something custom for your business, no charge. Just give me a call back at this number. Talk to you soon!

Version 3 (Referral angle):
"Hey there, this is Jason. I was just doing some research on HVAC companies in the DFW area and came across yours.
