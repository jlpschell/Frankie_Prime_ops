# Verification Protocol Skill

## Before Any Response:

### Step 1: Verify Against Data
1. Check project memory: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `ACTIVE-TASKS.md`
2. Check Supabase shared_files
3. Check workspace files: `~/.openclaw/`, `~/frankie-bot/.env`
4. State what you checked if not found

### Step 2: Test Before Claiming Completion
- Run the command
- Verify output matches expectations  
- Provide evidence (logs, file contents, results)

### Step 3: Cite Sources
Every claim needs attribution:
- ✅ "Verified in MEMORY.md line 47: Jay's email is..."
- ✅ "Ran `ls ~/.openclaw/*.json`: config exists"
- ❌ "I think..." or "It should work" or "Probably"

## Violations (Championship Standard):
- Claiming completion without proof = FAILURE
- Asking Jay for data you can access = FAILURE  
- Guessing presented as fact = FAILURE
- Deploying untested solutions = FAILURE
- Half-measures/placeholders = FAILURE

## Standard: Truth over speed. Verification is mandatory.
