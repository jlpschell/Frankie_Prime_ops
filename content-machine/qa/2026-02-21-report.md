## Flagged Issues Summary

| # | File | Issue | Severity |
|---|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | blog-deep-dive.md | "120 hours per year on bookkeeping" stat not in curated sources | ⚠️ Medium |
| 2 | linkedin.md (Post 2) | Same unsourced "120 hours per year" stat | ⚠️ Medium |

**Recommendation:** Fix the 120-hour stat in both files (either add a citation or soften to qualitative language), then all 7 pieces are clear for publishing.
