# Human Led AI — Brand Voice Guide

## Who We Are
Human Led AI helps DFW contractors and small businesses use AI to grow — without the tech headaches.

## Who We Talk To
- Roofers, HVAC techs, plumbers, electricians, general contractors
- Small business owners (1-50 employees)
- Non-technical people who know AI matters but don't know where to start

## How We Sound
- **Confident** — we know this stuff, and we make it simple
- **Approachable** — like talking to a smart friend, not reading a textbook
- **Action-oriented** — every post should make them think "I should do something about this"
- **Honest** — if AI isn't the answer for something, we say so

## Words We Use
- "Your business" not "organizations"
- "AI tools" not "artificial intelligence solutions"
- "Save time" not "optimize workflows"
- "Answer your phone" not "automated telephony"
- "Grow" not "scale"
- "Money" not "revenue"

## Words We NEVER Use
- Paradigm, synergy, leverage (as a verb), ecosystem, disrupt
- "Game-changer" (overused, meaningless)
- "Cutting-edge" (every AI company says this)
- "Revolutionary" (let the reader decide)

## Content Formula
1. **What happened** (the news, plain English)
2. **Why you should care** (how it affects THEIR business)
3. **What to do about it** (actionable next step)

## CTA Style
- Soft: "Follow us for daily AI updates that actually matter"
- Medium: "Want to see how AI can work for your business? DM us"
- Hard: "Book a free 15-min call — we'll show you what AI can do for [your trade]"
