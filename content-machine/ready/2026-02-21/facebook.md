Big AI news this week that actually affects small business owners — here's the quick version:

🔒 **A lawyer lost his entire Google account** after uploading documents to Google's AI tool. Gmail, Google Voice, Photos — all gone. No warning. If your business runs on Google, this is your sign to back everything up today.

💰 **AI bookkeeping just got a $14.5M boost.** A startup called InScope (built by actual accountants) raised big money to automate financial reporting for small businesses. Translation: cheaper, better bookkeeping tools are on the way.

⚠️ **Amazon's AI caused a 13-hour outage** — then Amazon blamed the humans watching it. Classic.

🤖 **A Google VP warned** that companies just reselling ChatGPT with a new logo are going to get crushed. If you're paying someone for AI services, ask what they actually do that you can't do yourself.

The bottom line: AI is getting more powerful every week. The businesses that win are the ones using it smartly — with a human still in charge.
