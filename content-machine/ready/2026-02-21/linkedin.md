A lawyer lost access to his entire Google account — Gmail, Voice, Photos — after uploading documents to Google's NotebookLM.

No warning.
No quick fix.
No human to call.

If your business depends on Google services, this is a wake-up call.

Here's what I'd do today:

→ Back up your Gmail contacts and emails
→ Export your Google Drive
→ Save your Google Voice number separately
→ Think twice before feeding sensitive documents into AI tools you don't control

AI is powerful. But "powerful" and "safe" aren't the same thing.

The tool works for you — until it doesn't. Keep a human in the loop.

What's your backup plan if you lost your Google account tomorrow? 👇

InScope just raised $14.5M to automate financial reporting for small businesses.

The team? Built by accountants, not just engineers.

Here's why this matters:

Small businesses spend an average of 120 hours per year on bookkeeping.
That's three full work weeks.
Doing work that AI can now handle in minutes.

We're entering a new era for small business finance:
→ AI handles the grunt work
→ Humans handle strategy
→ Costs drop as competition heats up

You don't need to switch tools today. But you should:

1. Start digitizing your receipts and records
2. Turn on AI features in QuickBooks or FreshBooks
3. Keep your CPA for the important decisions

AI should handle what you hate so you can focus on what makes you money.

Are you still doing your own books on Sunday nights? There's a better way coming. 👇
